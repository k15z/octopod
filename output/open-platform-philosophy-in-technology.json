    "description": "The podcast emphasizes the importance of creating an open platform for technological advancements. It mentions the necessity for individuals to be able to easily create servers and content, drawing parallels to the internet's philosophy at the time. The discussion underscores the role of accessibility and flexibility in fostering creativity, as exemplified by the simplicity of implementing web servers and creating web pages during the early stages of internet development.",

    "text": " rule that we had at the time, which was a, which was sort of consistent with the internet philosophy  of the time was it had to be an open platform. And specifically it had to be whatever it was,  it had to be where anybody could create servers and anybody could create content.  And so it had to be very easy to do that. And so, and you remember in those days,  it was sort of famous that you could implement a web server and four lines of Perl script,  right, to do whatever you wanted. And so, and you could create a web page just by writing HTML  by hand. And then by the way, people did and they were scaling issues with those four long  time web servers. That's how a lot of the big internet companies started out that way. Yes.  And then that's one of the reasons why the sites always crashed is exactly, but, but the point was,  the point was to optimize for, it was to optimize for the quality of experience and then optimize  for the openness and the creativity that would follow. Yeah. And again, there was a leap there,  right? And we got, you remember, we got a lot of criticism at the time, which was, wow, you know,  these, a lot of computer scientists at the time were like, wow, these guys are building the most  inefficient, you know, computer systems have ever been built. This thing is incredibly  inefficient. It's unoptimized. It's, you know, wasting network bandwidth. Where's the,  where's the ace in one encoding? Like this is strings. You guys are crazy. You're wasteful.  Wasteful. Yeah. Yeah. Big, you know, environmental arguments. You're burning, you know, power,  causing pollution. Yeah, we, these are all text-based protocols. So one of the, one of the design  principles was all protocols have to be text-based. There were no binary protocols. Text-based  protocols are much less efficient, much, much slower. But the enormous advantage is you can  program a text-based protocol by writing text. And you can read it by reading text, whereas if  it's in a binary format, you're always dealing with an, with an intermediary system, and it's just  harder to develop for and harder to understand. Do your source, you know, the,  There's a little counter to the, the belief of the computer science world at the time.  I mean, everybody read on ASM one encoding is that you have to do that.  Yeah. Any CS professor of that era who looked at this said they're doing it wrong.  100%. They said they're absolutely doing it wrong. Because it's not optimized. I mean,  so much of computer science at that point was about optimizing scarce resources, because  that was all you had at that time. And they had spent, you know, decades figuring out how to do  that. And we just decided, we, you know, we collectively decided to just break that rule.  And again, it was, it was, it was not to break the rule, just to break it. It was because what was  on the other side of breaking that rule was openness and creativity and empowerment. And  anybody can do anything. And then. Inclusivity, right? You didn't have to be a computer scientist,  networking expert to, to build a web server. Yeah, that's right. And the experience people  had, you know, the killer, the killer kind of version of this that ended up working really  well was this idea of view source. Yeah. And so there was this feature built that we built into"
