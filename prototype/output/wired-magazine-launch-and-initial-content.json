    "description": "The podcast discussed encountering Wired Magazine for the first time, specifically issue number one. Despite the magazine focusing on topics of interest, it did not mention the Internet, which was a significant aspect of the work being done at NCSA. This highlighted a disconnect between mainstream media coverage and the groundbreaking projects being worked on.",

    "text": " walking in one night and there was this new magazine on the newsstand called Wired.  And it was Wired issue number one. Yeah. And I was like, Oh, that's interesting,  you know, it's, you know, it's a magazine about this. It appears to be a magazine that's about  things that I'm interested in, which is novel, novel concept at the time. And so I bought it and  I took it back to my office and I read it cover to cover and they did not have the word Internet  in it once. Yeah. And I was like, Okay, you know, it was like, Okay, like, I guess I don't  count, you know, I guess, I guess, I, you know, I don't count, we don't count this whole thing  doesn't count. You know, these are the experts, like they have a magazine, or pros, you know,  these. Yeah, these are the pros. And like, you know, what we're working on is clearly not important  enough to mirror the magazine. And so I was just like, Okay, I guess we're just going to keep working  on our thing. But like, you know, it's sort of like this constant message from the media, which  is like, This is not important. This is not important. This is not important. So anyway,  so Jared had this whole story is ready to go. And, and he could not get his editors to run it.  And then later in 93, John Markoff at the New York Times figured this out. And he was  a good tech reporter. I mean, John Markoff is a smart guy. Yeah.  Legendary, legendary, legendary, you know, tech reporter going back, you know, quite, quite a  bit, you know, still very active. But at the time, he was like a veteran and was very well  respected in the industry and wrote a bunch of good books and so forth. And so he wrote a story  for the New York Times. And so the good news is he wrote a story. The bad news is it featured  my boss and my boss's boss. Who had nothing to do with the project? Who had you work on  something entirely else? Well, my boss, my boss at the time to his credit, you know, he was aware  and he, you know, he kind of, you know, he kind of, you know, he didn't vigorously oppose us. And  then he supported us. And then he ultimately sort of adopted as a project. And so he kind of  used his way into it, but he ultimately was very supportive. And then, but my boss's boss was the  director of NCSA at the time. And look, this is one of those things where I like, I owe these guys  a tremendous amount, because they created this environment that I was able to do my work in.  And I wouldn't be here today, if not for them. But, you know, you know, I kind of, I kind of a  little bit of an iffy relationship with my boss to start with. And then I had never met my boss's  boss. Right. And there was no reason for me to meet my boss's boss, because I'm like an undergraduate  like staff member, like, you know, he's a big, like a huge, he's like a huge important researcher,  astrophysicist, and, you know, directing this huge super computing center. So he had no reason  to meet me. But, you know, the story shows of the New York Times, it's smiling photos of the two  of them and not, you know, Eric and me. And I'm like, Oh, okay, I see how this works.  And how did you feel at the time? Because I know how you would feel now if that it happens. But  like, how did you feel then? It was just a little bit, I don't know, it was a little bit,  it was a little bit annoying, but it was also a little bit of like, look, it's the New York Times,  like, I don't know, you know, I don't, I guess they write about important people, right? And  these are important people because they're running this thing. And I'm not an important person,  because I'm only writing code. And, you know, it's like the project is important enough where  they can write about the project, but like the people actually writing the code are not important  enough to talk about. And so it's like, it's kind of the same reaction I had to Wired Magazine,  which is like, it's a little bit annoying, but I guess it means I just need to go back to work,  because there's, there's nothing else to be, it's not like I can call the, it would never occur to  me to call the editor of the New York Times and complain. Nor would he have taken my call, you  know? And so, he certainly didn't know who I was, because it certainly wasn't in the story.  So, so it was, you know, it was just like, it was like whatever, but it's like this weird, you  know, it's like the Play-Doh shadows on a cave wall thing, which is just like, okay, there's this,  there's all these things that people believe, right, including up to the internet is like doomed,  and there's never going to be a thing, and it's going to get swamped and, and all these things.  And then, and then we're just like, okay, no, we just have this stuff in front of us, and it just  plainly works, and we believe in it. And I guess we're just going to keep working on it. And maybe  people will figure out maybe they want. Anyway, so Jared, Jared Samberg calls me up, I remember the  day that story broke in the New York Times, Jared Samberg calls me up, and he's just absolutely  livid. And he told me that he, he got the morning paper, and you know, this is like six months later,  something after he, you know, he would have had the scoop. He would have had the first story on  basically on all of this stuff. And he literally told me the story, he said he charged into his  office that morning and slapped the New York Times down to the desk in one of these dramatic  moments and said, you know, see, I told you so, you know, John Markov front page of the business  section, I told you this was actually a story. And his boss is like, Oh, yeah, I guess, I guess  you were right. Oh my God, that's so crazy. So that's how again, the heresy like that's how  heretical it was, it was like actually, it was actually hard to get it in print. And I think  the only reason it showed up in the New York Times is John Markov was such a legend. He was  just a legendary, he was further along in his career at that point. So 93 was a phenomenal,  you know, phenomenal year, because it was the takeoff year for the, it was the takeoff year  for the web for the browser for for all this stuff for mosaic. Yeah, and so it was, and then,  you know, the other part of it was just the ping pong effect was very interesting, which was,  it was basically was, you know, it started out with like a few people with browsers and then a  few people with web servers, putting up, you know, these little individual pieces of content,  but then you got in this kind of feedback loop back and forth, kind of ping pong thing where  basically every time there was a new compelling piece of content put online, there was a reason  for people to start using the browser. But and then and then every time more people started  using the browser, there was an additional incentive to put more more content online, right?  And so it was like, it was like the writers, you needed writers and readers. And so more writers  met more readers, more readers met more writers. And so, and this is what our partner Andrew Chen  refers to as the cold start problem, right, is, is by default, if you have a situation like that  where you're going to have a network, you know, at scale, it's going to be great, but like to  actually get it to scale is actually really hard. And most things that need to have that kind of  network effect, never get past the cold start problem, right? They just they strangle early  because, you know, there's just not enough, not enough writers, which means there's not enough  readers, there's not readers, there's not enough writers. But this, the openness completely was  a winner for you. Yeah. That's right. And so what happened from the very beginning was people all  over the world started creating web servers and started putting up content. And and they either  they either used NCSA mosaic, the NCSA web server, which actually later became Apache. So it's  actually still kind of in use today. You know, it's late, you know, this derivation is much later.  Or you know, they literally could write their own web servers for the reasons we described earlier.  And so there was no content arriving online. And just to give people a sense of this, in early 93,  it was like one new website a day. And by the way, by one new website, I don't mean like one new  web, I don't mean like a new eBay a day or something, I mean, like a new web page. Yeah,  I remember it was a big day, the first restaurant menu came online was like a big it was like an  Indian restaurant in like some second tier city in England, just decided to somebody put the menu  online. And then it was remember the first webcam. So the first, the first streaming video, first  webcam was a coffee pot. And it was literally a coffee pot, because the guy had actually rigged  up a camera, an early webcam at the time, camera at the time, with the coffee pot down the hall,  in some computer science department somewhere so that he could see when the coffee pot was  emptying and go refill it. And then he basically just so just pure utility for him. And then he  put the coffee pot online, it was the first webcam. And so we all sat for like a week and just  watched the coffee pot. Yeah, yeah, why put around the land when I can put it on the internet?  Yeah, exactly. And then, you know, you can see it from home, right? And so, you know, we all watched  the communal coffee pot. And so, you know, there was that. And anyway, so then one of the features  built into mosaic was what was called, we had the was called the what's new page. And that was  another something that I had at the time, which was basically was sort of one of the first blogs  or maybe the first one where it was every day, it was okay, it was literally here are the new  webpages for that day. And it was this period doubling thing where it started out being here's  the new web page for today, right? And then it was and then it was a big deal when it started to be  to a day, right? And then for a day and then six a day and then eight a day. And then, you know,  by the end of the year, you know, I couldn't couldn't keep up anymore.  Add the what's cool web page. Well, then we added the what's cool page,  the right and the most cool page was the good stuff, exactly the editorial function. So,  yeah, so that was, yeah, that that was a key moment. Getting to the windows and the Mac versions  were key moment because, you know, they followed. And those guys did a great job on those and that  that really opened things up. And then and again, this was leading up to I guess, AOL formally  interconnected into the internet in September 93. So this was leading up to that period. And they  I don't remember in AOL released their first built in there. I don't remember that when they  first built in a web browser into AOL. Yeah, that was I think, yeah, I think it was. Yeah. But you"
