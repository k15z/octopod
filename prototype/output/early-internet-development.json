And, you know, they were sort of a they were a little basically  contract research organization, very smart, like CS people in Palo Alto doing like work for the  government for companies, you know, kind of very leading edge stuff. And then they just had, you  know, they to their credit, they were on the internet idea early. And, and so, you know, they  they wanted to kind of create see if they could create like internet software products, which  was a very kind of new idea at the time. And so, you know, they made me an offer, and they flew  me out and I moved out. And it was great. And I went to work there. And, you know, I was like,  okay, you know, I'll work on some internet, see if there's a way to make money on internet  software. And then, you know, what happened was just I just kept having this kind of out of body  experience, though, which was just like, and at that point, the internet started to get like  serious media coverage. And, you know, if you remember those days, the books started to show up.  And so, you know, before people had the internet, what happened was there were books about the  internet. And these these, this is where the O'Reilly, you know, O'Reilly publishing company  became famous at the time and so forth is, is you'd have actually at the peak of this in 94, 95,  you'd have walls and walls of books about the internet in bookstores, and they'd be like guides  to the internet, how to use the internet, how to write web pages, how to do all these things.  And then there would often be like a floppy disk in the back of the book, which would have the  software, the TCP IP stack, your TCP IP stack for Windows, all that. Yeah. Yeah. And then they'd  have mosaic or they'd have, you know, whatever on the on the on the on the desk. And so it, you  know, this started to become a thing and people started to figure this out. And the press started  to take it seriously. And there started to be more interesting content. And so it's like, okay,  the thing is going. And I'm like, you know, I kind of like I left mosaic behind. And so I, you  know, I didn't have the, you know, the email addresses anymore and so forth. But I knew how  much commercial demand there was. And so, so they get but it was this like really schizophrenic  thing. It was just like very unclear. And again, like I said, I had never heard of venture capital.  So I didn't really have a sense you could start a company. I didn't really know what to do. And  then, you know, another great kind of stroke of luck in my life was I got a call from Jim Clark,  who's the, you know, co founder of our company Netscape, you know, who was this legendary figure.  And I won't do the full version of all this because this gets into stuff that has already  been people have talked about a lot in the past. He's already plenty, plenty well documented. But,  you know, he had been a co founder of the founder of this company, Silicon Graphics, which was one  of the leading tech companies of the era. And then he got sideways with the CEO there. He decided  to leave and start his second company. But he had a non solicit agreement with, you know,  all the great people that he had, you know, he couldn't hire the people at SGI.  The SCI was an amazing team that he had put together.  Amazing team. But he had a formal, you know, he had a formal agreement that he couldn't  hire them. So and he and he had stock SGI with every smart person he knew. So he, you know,  most of the people who he wanted to work with where he couldn't get. And so he, he basically  was like, he was literally like sniffing around for talent. And a guy who worked for him,  Bill Foss, who later joined Netscape, apparently mentioned Jim one day is like, you know, the,  you know, one of the guys who made this mosaic browser is like, apparently he just like moved  to Silicon Valley. And he likes, you know, the about page the browser says he's, you know,  he's available, you know, maybe you should go talk to him. And so Jim called me up and we had  breakfast. And which was a very traumatic experience for me because I was not eating  breakfast in those days. Because I was not getting up early enough to have breakfast.  Yeah, yeah, I remember those used to wake up much later.  Yeah, I was a programmer hours. And so I had to be up at seven in the morning to meet Jim for  breakfast at Ulfornio and Palo Alto at seven a.m. on Sunday. So I had to recalibrate my entire  sleeping schedule that week to try to make the meeting. And I was still blurry when I got there.  But that good coffee. And so anyway, so Jim and I, you know, again, without belaboring it,  Jim and I decided to start a company. But it was still this weird thing where and Jim knew  all about the internet, the browser, and, you know, I was still watching everything. But it was  still this thing of like, it's just not, it's not a, it's just the overwhelming assumption in  the industry was this is not a serious thing. This is not a real thing. This is a momentary  thing. It's going to go away. The big companies are going to take over. This is not going to be a  the internet is not going to be a commercial medium. It's not going to happen.  And so our first two business plans for our company actually were not this. It was we had a  business plan. We had our first business plan was to do interactive software for interactive  television. So the build software to replace the guy on the roller skates that I told you about.  Jim had because Silicon, Jim's company had been one of the main companies building those systems.  And so he had the insight on that. And so we were going to do that. But then we sort of priced out  like what, you know, we sort of modeled out sort of how interactive TV was getting what it was  going to cost. Now it's going to work. And we actually concluded it wasn't going to work. It was  it was it was too expensive. And the technology wasn't ready. So we gave up on that idea.  And then and then plan number two was Jim had a really good relationship with the CEO of Nintendo  because SGI had done this deal to do the first 3D graphics chip for a game console,  which is the Nintendo 64. And so he went to visit the guy in Japan who ran Nintendo.  This super genius guy, Yama Ushisan, who ran basically built modern Nintendo, as we know it  today. And basically struck a handshake deal to basically build, you know, the online service  for the Nintendo gaming machines. And so to build basically what today you would call Xbox Live or  the PlayStation Network. But to do that, you know, it's probably a little early for that idea.  Also too early. Yeah. That was closer, though.  It was closer. But like again, it was modems, right? It would have been all dial up.  And so you would have you would have been doing interactive gaming on dial up modems  with like 1414 kilobit modems and with low latency. And so it and actually Nintendo actually had  had an online service on their earlier devices in Japan. And they actually had an early online  Nintendo online or whatever they called it that had like it had like early e-commerce. And it was  a proprietary system, but it had like early e-commerce and I think it had food delivery  in the 80s. And so there was like an early version of this, but it didn't quite take. And so this  idea was to do the modern version of it. But we again, we modeled the whole thing out. I like  built all the spreadsheets and how all the modem banks you would need and all this stuff. And we  just we figured out that it couldn't quite work. And so literally, we took a walk and it was like  it was like it was like a discouraging thing, because it's like we have these two ideas that  didn't pan out. And it's like, you know, should we like, you know, should we still is there still  anything to do together? And, you know, and I remember saying on the walk, it's like, you know,  well, that, you know, this, this internet thing keeps going, right? Like, it's, it's going. And  think about what we had just experienced there between Jim and I, which is like, okay, what  basically what the, what the, what the press was telling everybody and all the experts were telling  us was it was either going to be the big companies were going to do interactive television, or it  was going to be these, you know, home, you know, sort of video game like service. It was going to  be, the assumption is it was going to be one of those. Those are going to replace the internet  when, when this stuff got serious for consumers. And then, and we basically concluded that  when daddy, so you little kids can go play in your room. Oh, yeah. Yeah. If you read, if you  look at the magazines, and I keep bringing up the magazines, because at the time, again, this is like  the internet's getting started. And so the way people got their news was literally reading one of  the three big news magazines are reading one of the three big newspapers, like that's how you  learned about things. And that's where all the experts showed up. And if you just go back and  look at the magazine covers from that era, it's basically all these big company CEOs just pouring  scorn on the internet, then declaring that it's a joke and a toy. And the thing that they're going  to come out with their proprietary thing is going to be so much better. And so, and so we  literally had this moment where, you know, it was just like, well, if we have proven to ourselves  that interactive TV is not going to work. And if we've proven to ourselves that you can't build  this based on these video game boxes, then it by process elimination, it kind of has to be the  internet. It's the only thing that works. Right. And it's like, and yes, it has every issue that  people complain about, it's slow, it's inefficient, it's insecure, there's no business on it, there's  no this and that and the other and it's hard to get online. And, you know, all this stuff, you  know, there's all these reasons to believe it wasn't going to work. But like, it was literally,  we literally knocked out all the other ideas and said, okay, like this thing is actually,  it has to be that it has to be the thing, it's the only thing that works. And then, you know,  and Jim is a Jim is a total, you know, whiz on these things and knew all about this stuff. And so,  you know, we sat down and said, well, what if we did this like incredible heretical idea? And he  had very heretical as late as this is April 94. You know, so still very, very, very far into this,  but still very heretical, which is like, how about we make a build a software company to make"
