    "text": " you know, Ben, I'm glad you just went through what you just went through. I totally agree. And  specifically look like this says a lot to do with the debate raging around AI right now.  Which is, you know, these big companies, you know, the big companies in those days had every  reason, you know, they had all these stories. By the way, a lot of the story the big companies  told about the internet early on was it's unsafe. And safe. And it was. And it wasn't true to that.  It was, you know, but it was literally going to be, I mean, there was an, it took a long time  for e-commerce to take off in retrospect, relative to how fast it could have taken off,  because people literally just were worried that their credit card was going to get stolen.  Like you had to get over that hump. And there was just this constant fear of like cyber crime  and this and that and then spam and abuse and like all these things. And so, and so the big  companies always had like all these reasons why they needed to have total control. And, you know,  the government needed to protect them and they needed to have all these regulations and they  needed to have, you know, they just did the world needed to be a world not of open systems,  like the internet, it needed to be a world of proprietary systems. And look, a lot of the way  the world works today is for proprietary systems, you know, the banking system is not open, right?  You know, you're, you're, you just, if the bank decides to debank you, they debank you,  or whatever it is, or if they don't want to let the money go through, they don't let the money  go through. And so, you know, most of the, most of the world, most of the economy is with these  big companies with total control. And so yeah, I think it's a, I wanted to go through that because  I think it's a, it's a, it's a major miracle when you're able to actually get one of these open  systems to work. And it's like, and then years later, you're just like, Oh my God, I can't believe  we almost had the much worse world where the big companies ran everything. But it is amazing how  the pattern keeps repeating. And it's specifically repeating again today, you know, today with AI.  Again, ironically, and to your point, ironically, some of the companies that are lobbying hardest  for regulatory capture and cartel, you know, kind of government cartel status for AI are companies"
