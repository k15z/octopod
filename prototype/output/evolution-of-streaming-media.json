So they, they wanted to do what they called at the time, interactive television.  And the big, the big killer app for internet, for interactive television was, was called video on  demand. And so sort of the revolutionary idea at that time that instead of watching whatever was  on a TV channel at that moment, you could watch whatever you want, you know, by clicking a button,  and then maybe you could also order a pizza. Interestingly, there is a small minor bandwidth  problem with that idea, if I recall it correctly. Yeah, it was actually an idea that was ahead of  its time, right? Streaming, streaming video didn't really work, you know, in the way that we understand  it today until like, you know, what, probably 15 years later, right? Oh, wait. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, well, really, when Netflix made the cutover from CDs to, to streaming, which was  the late 2000s, right? Yeah, I remember meeting, I remember meeting with Reed Hastings and I  think 2004. And, you know, Netflix was up and running, it was very successful doing DVD rental  by mail. And he literally, you know, reads it reads a technical genius in addition to being a  business genius. And he said, you know, I'm thinking about, you know, doing streaming.  And my first reaction was that's crazy, it'll never work, because even even that lay even in 2004,  like most people on the internet, we're not, they didn't have broadband connections fast enough to  do like TV quality. So the video at that point was actually these little postage stamp sized videos.  And I was, I was like, Oh, I don't understand who's going to want to sit there and watch a little  postage stamp size thing. And but Reed had correctly extrapolated that broad, the broadband  wave in the 2000s was going to result in, in streaming working. But, but just give you a sense  of the delay there, even a, even it, right? So even a decade later, even a decade after the  founding of Netscape, development of mosaic and founding of Netscape in a decade later, it was  still considered weird and bizarre to turn to stream videos. So, so yeah, so the, yeah, so the  media companies that early, you know, like the media companies in the early 90s were not being  run by technologists. And, you know, and so they, they had a hard time, I think mapping.  There was a famous interactive television information superhighway trial in the early 90s  around this time, which was to do this, this video on demand. So to do this thing where you'd  have a remote and you could press a button and watch whatever movie you wanted. And I remember  they, they, it was a, it was a trial, they were trying to figure out if there would be consumer  demand for this. And so one of these companies set up a, they set up, they wired a neighborhood  to do the downs, the streaming of a video, but it wasn't digital switched, it was analog switched.  And so they had a dedicated long, basically analog line wired to each house.  And they had a, they had a, then in the back office, they had a bank of ECRs,  videotape players, and they had, they had a videotape player for each house.  And then they had a, they had a wall of videocassettes with all the movies that were  optioned. And then they had a guy on rollerskates and rollerskates to get to the rollerskates quick  enough to get, to get there quick enough. Cause the user expectation was you click the button,  you watch the movie. And so the guy on rollerskates had to like shoot over to the wall of videotapes,  pull down the right tape, and then shoot down the hall to the right VCR and get the tape and the  VCR and press play, you know, before, you know, the couch potato was like, I'd get, you know,  giving up cause the stream, the stream business started. And so, um, yeah, it was that idea was,"
