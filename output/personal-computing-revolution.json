    "description": "The discussion covers the transition of personal computing from the late 70s to early 80s with the popularization of personal computers like the Apple II. It delves into the affordability of early consumer computers, priced as low as $200, and the challenge of using cassette tapes for storage and program loading before the advent of floppy disks.",

And, you know, so there,  there was this moment when like the personal computer hit the popular consciousness. And that  was, you know, kind of, it was sort of built in the late 70s. And then it sort of, you know,  hit, sort of catalyzed hard in the early 80s, especially around 82. And then, you know, our  school, you know, even though it was very small, started to get, you know, a handful of, of early  computers. And then there were a wave of consumer computers at that time, actually, that were  actually quite inexpensive. And so, there were computers at that time as cheap as $200 in currency  at that point, which- And this is our floppy disk. So, this is pre-hard drive or post-hard drive  when you got your first computer. Pre-floppy disk?  Tape. Cassette tape.  Cassette tape, exactly, yes.  Okay, okay. That's a slow loader, bro.  You can power to load a game. I remember that era.  Yeah. So, for people who don't remember, but before floppy disks, they were, because you  literally, you literally hook up a cassette tape player. And the thing with a cassette tape player  is it didn't have any kind of seek capability, right? And so, the way that you loaded the  program was you had to go, you had to fast forward by hand at the right point on the tape.  Yeah.  Right. And then, and then, you know, you were always at risk of over, you know,  if you were going to write to the tape, you know, you wrote a program, you wanted to write it,  you, out of the tape, you just ran the risk, you were going to overwrite, you know, something in  the past. Yeah.  And then, and then there was this really fundamental trade-off. If you were, you know,  if you didn't have a lot of money, it's this very fundamental trade-off, which is you could buy a  short cassette tape that was high quality. Yeah.  Right. And it would store a small amount of stuff, or you could buy a inexpensive, you know,  you could buy the same price, you could buy a cassette tape that was much longer and could  record a lot more, but at much lower quality. And that mattered because the lower quality tapes  frequently, you actually would never, you would not be able to read back what you had written.  And so there was a real, there was a real quality, quality, quality trade-off."
