    "description": "The podcast explored the concept of the cold start problem in network effects and its relevance to web development. It explained the challenge of initiating network growth, emphasizing the interdependence between content creators and readers.

But and then and then every time more people started  using the browser, there was an additional incentive to put more more content online, right?  And so it was like, it was like the writers, you needed writers and readers. And so more writers  met more readers, more readers met more writers. And so, and this is what our partner Andrew Chen  refers to as the cold start problem, right, is, is by default, if you have a situation like that  where you're going to have a network, you know, at scale, it's going to be great, but like to  actually get it to scale is actually really hard. And most things that need to have that kind of  network effect, never get past the cold start problem, right? They just they strangle early  because, you know, there's just not enough, not enough writers, which means there's not enough"
