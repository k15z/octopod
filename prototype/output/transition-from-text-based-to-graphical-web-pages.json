And that was, of course, you know, that that was then the thing that really,  you know, kind of just got lit on fire. Yeah, you famously invented the image tag, if I recall.  So there was a big dispute. There was a big dispute early on. So there was a big dispute.  So there was a, there was opposition early on within the internet community. And I won't,  I won't name names, but within the set of people who were into this kind of thing working on it.  There was actually a lot of controversy around the idea of adding images. And there was,  there was a big argument. There are actually multiple arguments to not add images. And by  the way, to not images means not make it graphical, right? Not, not bring it into the gooey world.  And, and, you know, one argument was just efficiency. Again, network optimization,  use of resources, you know, not, you know, and by the way, you know, sort of an equality argument,  you know, not everybody has a graphical workstation. Right.

And if you have mass market content, that's going to draw more of the wrong kinds of users.  A valid argument.  It turns out it turns out that argument was correct. But, but, well,  yes. Well, it was, it was, it was correct. The people made that argument were correct  based on their own presuppositions. Yeah. I was, I was on the other side of that argument. And I  was on, I was on the other side of each, each of those arguments. But specifically on that argument  is I just always thought everybody should be able to use this. I was very much on the side of,  this is amazing. Everybody on the planet should be on the internet. Everybody on the internet  should be on the web. Everybody on the web should be graphical. Like there's, yes, there should be  content all over the internet that's graphical. There should be, you know, all kinds of pictures  and movies, animations and streaming and games.
