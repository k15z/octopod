    "description": "The podcast explores the era of BBS, which served as precursors to social networks, offering early forms of email, user profiles, classified ads, and game downloads. Limited by high phone call costs and pre-broadband internet, BBS connected users via modems, providing a glimpse into online interactions before the internet as we know it today.",

We'll talk about the internet prehistory in a little bit,  but we didn't have that. What we did have, what, what was happening at that time was what were  called BBSs, which is, which is acronym for Bulls and Board Systems. And the, and you throw it  to think about these as BBSs were kind of pre, they're kind of pre-social networks in a way,  but the, this is pre-internet. And so the way this would work is the host of the BBS would  literally set up a set of modems in their house or apartment to, you know, often like eight or  12 or 20 or something to sort of with income, to take incoming calls from people with remote  computers. And then you, in theory, you could dial into BBSs and you just literally used a modem  and you dialed into the phone number for the BBS. And then if you got to the BBS, it was really cool  because you had access to, you know, you could, you know, early, early versions of like email and  social networking and user profiles and Bulls and Boards and classified ads and, you know,  downloading games and playing games and, and so forth. And so it's kind of, you know, pre-internet,  pre-AOL, you know, kind of versions of these things. The problem that I had was, you know,  again, rural Wisconsin, long as this phone calls were a dollar a minute, there are no BBSs in my  town. And so I read about, I read about BBSs. I actually don't, to this day, I think I never  actually used one because I couldn't afford it. But, and by the way, also, this is also pre-predates,  you know, broadband. And so this was the, when I first started on this stuff, this was the, the,  this was actually pre-modem, as we understand it today. So the form of the modem at the time  was what's called an acoustic coupler. And so you take your old fashioned telephone handset and  you literally put it, yeah, no, I remember those. Yeah. Right. In the two rubber cups. And then  it literally is like the audit, you know, it's literally using your, your handheld phone as,  as the receive transmit for the, for the audio signals. And so the acoustic coupler modems were  300 bod. Yeah. So 300 bits per second. Yes. And very, very noisy 300 bod. Yeah. Very noisy. Exactly.  So, yeah, very, very slow, very slow. So, so, you know, but you could kind of,  you could kind of get a glimpse, you know, I would say the, the romance of the personal  computer at that point was very clear. And that's what really got me was, because, and basically,  the way that you, you'd want a computer, you plugged it into your TV set in those days. And,  and what happened was you literally, you got injected into a, the basic programming language  interpreter. And what, what that showed up as is that it literally, the screen would say ready,  and then there was a cursor. And it was this invitation for, for kind of kids my age, it was  this invitation to basically do anything. Right. And so it was this, it was this kind of great moment  where you just kind of felt like the future was like in front of you. And then there were all  these, this became a pop kind of culture thing. And so there are all these books and magazines,  you know, that you could buy or subscribe to that, you know, we had all these, you know, you  literally, you literally subscribe to, you know, hobbyist magazine for what kind of computer you  had. And it would literally have printouts in the magazine of programs that you could actually  sit and type into your computer, you know, type into the, the basic prompt and make work. And so  there was this incredible sense of adventure for what you could do on a computer. And then,  and then there was this additional thing out there, which was, wow, like if you, if you could  afford it, you could be on BBS and you could talk to other people. And so they kind of had that"
