    "description": "The podcast highlighted NCSA's crucial role in the early days of web development. The adoption of NCSA mosaic, which later evolved into Apache, played a pivotal part in facilitating content creation and web server establishment worldwide. The openness of NCSA's tools contributed to the rapid growth of web servers and the availability of online content.",

But and then and then every time more people started  using the browser, there was an additional incentive to put more more content online, right?  And so it was like, it was like the writers, you needed writers and readers. And so more writers  met more readers, more readers met more writers. And so, and this is what our partner Andrew Chen  refers to as the cold start problem, right, is, is by default, if you have a situation like that  where you're going to have a network, you know, at scale, it's going to be great, but like to  actually get it to scale is actually really hard. And most things that need to have that kind of  network effect, never get past the cold start problem, right? They just they strangle early  because, you know, there's just not enough, not enough writers, which means there's not enough  readers, there's not readers, there's not enough writers. But this, the openness completely was  a winner for you. Yeah. That's right. And so what happened from the very beginning was people all  over the world started creating web servers and started putting up content. And and they either  they either used NCSA mosaic, the NCSA web server, which actually later became Apache. So it's  actually still kind of in use today. You know, it's late, you know, this derivation is much later.  Or you know, they literally could write their own web servers for the reasons we described earlier.  And so there was no content arriving online. And just to give people a sense of this, in early 93,  it was like one new website a day. And by the way, by one new website, I don't mean like one new  web, I don't mean like a new eBay a day or something, I mean, like a new web page. Yeah,  I remember it was a big day, the first restaurant menu came online was like a big it was like an  Indian restaurant in like some second tier city in England, just decided to somebody put the menu  online. And then it was remember the first webcam. So the first, the first streaming video, first  webcam was a coffee pot. And it was literally a coffee pot, because the guy had actually rigged  up a camera, an early webcam at the time, camera at the time, with the coffee pot down the hall,  in some computer science department somewhere so that he could see when the coffee pot was  emptying and go refill it. And then he basically just so just pure utility for him. And then he  put the coffee pot online, it was the first webcam. And so we all sat for like a week and just  watched the coffee pot. Yeah, yeah, why put around the land when I can put it on the internet?  Yeah, exactly. And then, you know, you can see it from home, right? And so, you know, we all watched  the communal coffee pot. And so, you know, there was that. And anyway, so then one of the features  built into mosaic was what was called, we had the was called the what's new page. And that was  another something that I had at the time, which was basically was sort of one of the first blogs  or maybe the first one where it was every day, it was okay, it was literally here are the new  webpages for that day. And it was this period doubling thing where it started out being here's  the new web page for today, right? And then it was and then it was a big deal when it started to be  to a day, right? And then for a day and then six a day and then eight a day. And then, you know,  by the end of the year, you know, I couldn't couldn't keep up anymore.  Add the what's cool web page. Well, then we added the what's cool page,  the right and the most cool page was the good stuff, exactly the editorial function. So,  yeah, so that was, yeah, that that was a key moment. Getting to the windows and the Mac versions  were key moment because, you know, they followed. And those guys did a great job on those and that  that really opened things up. And then and again, this was leading up to I guess, AOL formally"
