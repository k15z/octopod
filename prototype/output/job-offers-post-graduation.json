    "description": "The post-graduation experience of receiving job offers after updating the web browser's about page was shared. The individual had control over the about page and used it to signal their availability for hire. This led to multiple job offers, including considerations from companies in Silicon Valley, ultimately shaping the individual's career path in the tech industry.",

I was somewhat ambivalent as to which coast, but I definitely wanted to get to A coast.  And, and so I decided I needed a job. And so I, I, I, I, one of the things I had control of was  the about page for the web browser. And so I added to the about page for the web browser  that everybody used at the time I added saying, by the way, you know, one of the primary authors  of this browser is graduating and is available to be hired.

It was his project. And they I almost went there. But they had a phantom  stock option program. That doesn't sound good. I didn't know much. But like, if you're applying  the word phantom to your stock option program, that's not a good sign. Well, they had a classic  problem, which is they had a software group that they wanted to give an incentive to and they wanted  a hardware company where you have small stock options, right?  Exactly. And so they wanted this thing to be like a separate research thing,  but they didn't want to spin it off. They wanted to retain control of it.  And so they were creating basically a shadow stock option program. And I was just like,  I don't understand this. This sounds like a scam. So I turned that down. And then I went to this"
