    "description": "A substantial part of the podcast talks about the funding challenges faced by the developers due to their research institute background. It explores their decision to release the browser as open-source with a hybrid license tailored for academic and individual use. Moreover, it delves into the complications stemming from receiving commercial queries without a clear business model or support infrastructure in place.",

    "text": " of we're working for a research institute funded by the federal government.  And so, you know, we have, you know, we have no money, we have no revenue, we have no business  model, you know, if we got a product out there, that's taken off, it's taken off like crazy. And  then we put it out as open source, but under what's what is called a hybrid license, we put it  on under a hybrid license that says it's free for it's all free for academic and individual use  and profit use. But if you want to use it for commercial applications, you have to come talk  to us. And then, and then I had the I had the mailbox for the incoming commercial queries.  And I remember when it hit like 400 of basic of basic companies, you know, like general  councils and procurement officers at big companies saying, you know, we want to deploy this  throughout our company, you know, who do we pay? And we had no way to take the money. We didn't  even have like a price sheet. We didn't have any of this. And then very critically, we didn't have  any support, right? So we didn't have any customer support resources. And so we had the support  email address. And I also had that email box. In my spare time between coding sessions, I would  literally just like answer questions. And but it was literally it was, you know, it was supposed  to be tech support for mosaic, but it turned into tech support for the entire internet.  So I helped a lot of you know, the difference between that was the internet for everybody,  you know, and a lot of ways still is. Yep, exactly. And so so it really started to take it then  sort of became a formal project, it kind of got got embraced and became a real project  and got more resources. And then but we were you know, we were kind of just dying from the  overhead and you know, we needed more servers and we needed more people and the whole thing.  And so we wrote, I remember we wrote a proposal to for a grant, we wanted an incremental grant  from the National Science Foundation, and it was to staff a customer support desk  so that we could support as we could hire like, you know, whatever people customer support.  Yeah, yeah. So this is actually my first trip to Washington, DC, as we we issued this grant,  we sent it to Dan and in it, and the National Science Foundation people to their credit,  they were fascinated by this whole thing and they were glad that it was working.  But you know, we send in this grant is the only place we had any sense of where to get money  and we send this grant and literally it came back denied. You know, the National National  Science Foundation is not in the business of, you know, funding customer support. One of the  one of the sort of fun twists here is, okay, you idiot, like this like giant commercial  opportunity is staring you in the face. Like you've you literally have like inbound sales leads  like coming out of your ears, like why don't you go raise venture capital and start a company?  Yeah. And of course, the answer was because I had no idea that there was such a thing as  venture capital venture capital. I literally know what attractor was.  Yes, exactly. You know, I had no conception whatsoever for, you know, for I had just no  clue at the time that it was actually a tractable thing that you could you could you could do that."
