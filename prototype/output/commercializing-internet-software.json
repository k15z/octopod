    "description": "The podcast narrates the journey of building a software company to create internet software, a decision considered heretical at the time. It reflects on the initial doubts and risks associated with the idea, which later proved to be the most obvious choice. The host recalls the commercialization process and how it paved the way for future successes.",

    "text": " and Jim is a Jim is a total, you know, whiz on these things and knew all about this stuff. And so,  you know, we sat down and said, well, what if we did this like incredible heretical idea? And he  had very heretical as late as this is April 94. You know, so still very, very, very far into this,  but still very heretical, which is like, how about we make a build a software company to make  internet software? And like, and that was just like, wow, this seems, you know, you know, that  seems like a risky, crazy idea. Now, in retrospect, it was like the most obvious idea of all time at  that moment. Yeah. But that's, that's the true story of how we actually got to that idea. So,  so anyway, we ended up basically commercializing, you know, we ended up basically building the  commercial version of everything that we had built at Illinois, it just we got through the hard  way. Yeah. It was not the obvious idea. Counter programming, conventional wisdom, and media advice  is still still works now. It's amazing. It's incredible. I just I have this constant I live  in this constant state of out of body, you know, kind of experience amazement, where these people  just show up on TV or in the papers or whatever. And they're just they have all these credentials.  And they've got all these degrees, they've got all these initials after their names, and they've  got these incredible resumes, and they've got all these publication credits, and they've got all  this stuff and these government grants and like on like every possible credential and  Harvard at MIT and like all this stuff. And they just they say shit. And I just I'm, and I'm just  like, like, okay, like maybe they're right, but like, if they're wrong, and they're wrong, like a  lot of the time, like, okay, what consequences did they bear for being wrong? And the answer is  not at all zero. Yeah. And they're just back on tomorrow. On tomorrow, with some new light of  bullshit. And they there's this great book, I often tell friends, this great book, this guy,  Phil Tetlock, who's a professor who studies this exact topic. And it's this great book, it's called  expert political judgment. And he did this comprehensive study of the he came out of  through political predictions. So basically, you know, experts showing up in, you know,  columns in the newspaper and on TV talking about like, is there going to be a war here?  You know, what's going to happen with Israel or whatever, all these predictions. And he goes  through and he basically, he basically the conclusion of it is that the sort of average,  well credentialed expert in the media on any topic, evolving sort of policy or global affairs is  somewhat less, is somewhat less than random, likely to be correct. So the credentialed experts  to score it like 40%. And a monkey flinging, you know, shit at a dartboard is like 50%.  Right, monkey. And the big thing that he points out is there's no, there are no  repercussions for being wrong. There are no, there's no career damage, there's no economic  damage, there's no nothing. And then he says the thing, if they were, if they were being,  if they were being epistemically honest, the thing that they would do is like when the talking  heads on TV talking about something, there would be a scoreboard and it would show like their last  20 predictions. And then it would have like, you know, red or green, were they right or wrong?  It's because it'd be the only way to ever have a sense of whether you're talking to somebody who  knows what they're talking about. And that scoreboard, of course, never appears. Never materialized.  You never, ever, ever, ever see it. And he pointed that he wrote this book like 20 years ago,  and like everybody read it, and they're like, yeah, that's right. And then everybody just  completely ignored it and kept doing things the same way that they're doing it. And so I just,  I had this like, I had this experience where I just feel, I just feel like a complete like, I, I  mean, you know, it worked out, but like, I just, I still feel dumb is in the sense of like, I read  all this stuff, I believed it all the time, it caused me to be insecure about the thing that I  was actually doing that I saw was actually working. I knew it was working like, and I knew why it was  working. And I knew why it would keep working. And even still, it was just this wall of wall of  doubt and skepticism that kind of kept kept kept eating away at me. So yes, the good news is we've  used that to our advantage, you know, many times since then. I remember when, when we made the  Coinbase investment, I guess, Bitcoin, which was the one cryptocurrency at the time was,  I don't know, was some number of hundreds of dollars. And everybody, economists, everybody  was writing that it was a complete scam and total bullshit, and never be worth anything.  And here it is, I don't know what it's worth today, like 63, $64,000, something like that.  And yeah, all you have to do is just listen to the experts and do the opposite. And you make so  much money. Yeah, yeah, it's amazing. Yep, it's amazing. But I tell you, it's hard. Like, I, you  know, I don't know about you, like, I feel like I still have this problem. Like, I now have like  30 years of evidence that this, this is all the case. And even still, it's just like, I still  have this problem where I'm like, okay, the experts say it's still like a real effort of will.  They don't actually know what they're talking about. They don't actually have any predictive  capability. They're in a system where the incentives are absolutely terrible.  Well, I always find like, if somebody's super dismissive about something, that's a great thing  to study. Because it's almost surely not a dead zero, right? Like, it may not work, but there's  no way it's as bad as they're, you know, saying that if somebody says something is like, a scam,  or a Ponzi scheme, or a bullshit, or this, then that's almost always worth looking into.  So you started Netscape with Jim Clark. It was actually called Mosaic, right at the time.  Yeah. So, so we, so we, you know, again, I had graduated. We, you know, the other people,  the other, you know, the other, our other colleagues at Illinois were, you know, working  either they were either students or staff members there. Everybody was working under  federal research funding on a specifically non-commercial project, you know, which was open  source, you know, there's, and so, you know, like I said, there was no, you know, there was no,  the university didn't have, there was no commercial, anything, you know, of value, at least according  to what everybody thought at the time. And so we start Netscape. We actually go out, Jim and I  actually flew back out to Urbana in the middle, and there was still an incredible snowstorm,  and hired, you know, I think basically all but one, I think, of the original Mosaic team members  to join us in Netscape. So that was the original thing. Most of them were able to move out to  California and were core members of what followed at Netscape. And so, and then we booted up the  company. We, and then we named it Mosaic, and that was sort of the first issue that got us in  trouble. And I should say the reason we named it Mosaic was not because we planned to literally  like offer Mosaic as a product. We very specifically decided we were going to leave the source code  behind. You wrote it like when you were skipping class. Yes. We knew it was not a commercial,  we knew it was not commercial grade. We knew it had all, you know, just had, it had just issues,  it had issue performance issues, it had, you know, you just, you create one of these things,  you know all the issues. And so we just knew it had all these issues. And so we knew we needed to  start from, we wanted to start from scratch and build kind of the correct commercial product.  And we knew what we needed to do to do that. And so we very specifically did not bring the"
