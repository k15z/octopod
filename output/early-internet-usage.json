    "description": "The podcast explores the early days of internet usage in the late 80s, focusing on the limited but pivotal applications available. It mentions tools like Telnet for remote computing, FTP for file transfer, early email systems, and news groups that served as primitive social networks. The online community primarily consisted of scientists, technical experts, and computer science majors, fostering high-quality discussions and interactions.",

    "text": " you know, like I said, email existed. Um, you know, what was the, how you, you asked how,  how do people use the internet in those days? Um, you know, so sort of pre-web, you know,  it was mostly, well, there was, you know, the leading apps at that point, there was an app called  Telnet, um, that you would use to basically log into another computer on the network. And that  was actually very important because that's how the scientists would use the super computers. Um,  and actually the group I was in at Illinois actually built one of the main Telnet apps.  Um, there was an app called FTP that was a file downloading app. And so you could upload and  download files. Um, there was early email. Um, so that worked. Um, there was early what were  called news groups, which is like basically four, you know, forums, you know, kind of early social  networking. Um, those were probably, Ben, I think at the time those were probably the four main  things that people did. And it was all scientists and computer science majors on the internet,  if I recall, I mean, there was really nobody else.  Yeah. So this is at the time 89, I'm going to guess there were somewhere between 500,000 to  a million people total online. Um, and yeah, it was basically the, it was basically the faculty,  staff and students at these four supercomputing centers. Um, it was the remote users and then  it was like the defense contractors got wired up early and then the, there were branches of the  government that got wired up early. Um, and then there was like the national labs. Um, and, um,  you know, there were, and then a handful of hobbyists would figure out a way to get online. And so,  yeah, so, so basically it was, you know, first of all, it was like 100% people in the West. Um,  you know, overwhelmingly the U.S. and Europe. Um, it was, um, you know, very heavily obviously  English dominated from the very beginning. Um, it was extremely, uh, uh, uh, technical scientific  oriented. Um, almost everybody on it had a scientific or technical degree. Um, it was also  very as a consequence of all that, the, you know, is this incredible, you know, brilliant, you know,  this is like a million of the smartest people on the planet. So the, the, the caliber of the people  and the quality of the discussions was like sky high. Oh yeah, I remember being, the old news  groups were unbelievable. I remember like there was like a, um, bug in a compiler. Like you could  find out about it and you know, they, there would be workarounds and like the level of expertise  on those things was absolutely astounding. Yeah. And look, many of the smartest people in the  scientific and technical world at that point were in there and they would talk to you, um,  if you had something interesting to say. And so if you posted on a news group, they, they,"
