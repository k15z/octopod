    "text": " because we are going to talk about the origin of the web browser and the invention of the web  browser. And we have one of the co inventors with us right here in Mark. So it's exciting. It's  also exciting because this story has never really been told either in its entirety or accurately.  And so we're going to get a chance to do that. And for those of you who are so young that you're  not quite sure what a web browser is anymore, it is kind of how most people experience the  internet. So you might call it the internet. It's a thing Chrome. It's what you get. It's what you  get when you click through on a Facebook link or a Twitter link or something.  Yes, exactly. All right. So let's start at the very beginning because one of the things  that is kind of one of the largest disinformation campaigns going is this whole idea that  people, entrepreneurs and people who invent things are kind of born with a silver spoon in  their mouth. And almost none of the successful entrepreneurs we work with is that the case  for they all come from somewhere between refugee and middle class backgrounds. And you certainly  were not born with a silver spoon in your mouth. So tell us a little bit about where you grew up.  You didn't grow up in a big city. You grew up in quite a small town. What was that like?  And then what is the light growing up in? How did you first encounter the internet?  Yeah. So let me, if I could, just to start our session today with kind of two  disclaimers, which maybe relate to your question. So disclaimer number one is we're going to be  talking about events that happened over 30 years ago. Little memory problems.  Yeah. So I'm going to tell the truth as I remember it. I may get things wrong or other  people may have different recollections. And so it's just, I have to disclaim that it's because  I can't swear to the, you know, factual accuracy of stuff that was that long ago, but I'll tell  the story as I understand it. And then look, I'd say the other story is there are twists and turns  along the way that are, you know, just like where I would just characterize it as at the time I was  irritated at other people for things that happened. I think in the fullness of time, what I realized  is that I just at the time completely lack the skill set and the perspective to navigate, I would  say interpersonal and in particular, you know, bureaucratic, you know, situations, you know,  I just had no, I had no clue how to do any of it. Yeah. Well, and so I think when you get into your  background, people will kind of understand how that. Yeah. So I was, I was like, I sometimes  describe myself as, I was, I was feral at this point in my life. And so, yeah, I just, you know,  if it's always this thing, if you could rerun prior events, like with the skills that I have  today, I could have navigated it much better and a bunch of things could have turned out different.  But I certainly did not have the skill set at the time. So,  yeah, so we'll maybe talk. So anyway, if it sounds like I'm criticizing other people, it's  actually not pretty, what I intend, it's going to be more ultimately criticizing myself in the  sense of, you know, whatever happened that I, that I didn't like at the time, I think I was at  least partly, partly, if not wholly responsible for. Yeah. Because I, you know, well, yeah,  young men can be like that from time to time, you know. Yes, I would say I was raw aggression  at that point with very, very little. And yes, you've been, of course, members of this,  because he met me, he met me shortly after the events we were about to talk about. So,  so, yeah, so, yeah, so I, yeah, I grew up in a, you know, it actually turns out to be a,  yeah, so, so first of all, like the modern cliche is, yeah, there's a, you know, Elon Musk, you  know, father had an emerald mine. Right. When he showed up in the US with like $2,000 is the  actual story. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So there's all these kind of fake, fake, fake histories that  are kind of ret, retconned into people who grew up in pretty, pretty, in some cases, pretty tough  backgrounds. Yeah. So I grew up in, so I grew up in the, in the Midwest, in the American Midwest,  in rural Wisconsin. And for people who haven't spent time in Wisconsin, there's, you know,  there's, there's basically three Wisconsin's, there's the, there's sort of the big city of Milwaukee,  which is like a very kind of, you know, kind of like a bit, almost like a Chicago, you know,  kind of thing. Then there's, but that's its own world. And then there's Madison, which is like a  very kind of hippie college town. Right. That was actually kind of a core of activity in the 60s.  And then there's the rest of Wisconsin, which is completely disconnected from those two cities,  which has nothing to do and has no interface into those two places at all, and is sort of the,  the rural Midwest, which is, you know, basically a farming country. And so,  actually, as I understand it,  Yeah, I think that's right. Yes. And so if you get 10 minutes outside of either, you know,  Milwaukee or Madison, you get into a rural, you know, real, real rural territory, you know,  in a, in a hurry. Right. And so, and, you know, this is, you know, I was, you know, there were  people in the, you know, the, in the farming world in the Midwest, you know, up through the 1970s,  that still didn't have indoor plumbing. Right. So like, you know, I, you know, I, you know, I,  I have, I have memories of outhouses. And, you know,  Well, for a while, you didn't have gas heat. So you weren't there for  There's also that exactly. So yes, if you want to heat your house, you cut down some wood.  And so, and yeah, and then, you know, look, it's up, it's up north and it's, you know,  very close to Canada. So it's extremely cold. And so it's actually kind of a, it's this amazing  thing where it sort of frozen tundra for nine months, and then three months of, of summer.  And then, you know, but mostly farming, you know, a lot of dairy farming, you know, a lot of corn  to feed, to feed the cows. So corn and cows. And then I'd say, you know, light manufacturing,  light tourism, you know, a lot of, a lot of Illinois people vacation up there, go hunting,  fishing or whatever. So, you know, a little bit of that, but mostly, mostly agricultural. Yeah.  And my town was sort of a populate sign of the outside of town forever, population 1300 and nine.  And you know, the sign never changed.  And a hearing journalist of whether you had 1308 or 1310.  Yeah, I don't think it actually moved around that much. So it's probably more or less accurate the  whole time. And then, and then of course, the running joke was that's 1300 and nine, including the  cows. So, so yeah, so very small town environment. So yeah, so, you know, kind of lower middle class,  you know, context and, you know, public public, you know, public eight through 12 school,  you know, 20 of my school was very small, 25 kids in a class.  So, you know, whatever 300 kids in the whole school.  Oh, a lot of people don't have a school choice today. You didn't have teacher choice either,  because here's, I guess, one teacher for every subject.  No, no, exactly. And then, you know, this is the 70s, this is the 70s, and then the 80s. And so,  you know, this, this predates not only predates the internet, you know, but this also predates  cable TV, you know, we had no cable TV, we had, you know, long distance phone calls,  we're still a dollar a minute. We still actually, my neighborhood growing up,  actually, we had a party phone line for the entire neighborhood.  That's interesting, which is actually quite, quite an adventure. And so,  there's a single phone number for the neighborhood. And so, when your phone rings,  everybody in the neighborhood picks up the phone. This is true. And then there's a,  there's an arbitration process, a verbal arbitration process for who the calls actually  for. And then the expectation, the expectation is that everybody else hangs up, but, you know,  they don't have to. Well, they say there are no secrets in the small town.  This is, this is, this is one of the reasons why. So, so, yeah, I mean, it was just, you know,  sort of, yeah, so it's sort of, you know, as I don't know, it's halfway between, you know,  it's halfway between the 1930s and the 1980s or something. It just is one of those places where,  you know, a lot of the, a lot of the country was like that at that point, which is it hadn't fully  adapted, you know, to kind of, you know, a lot of the things that we all, certainly the things  that we all now take for granted. And then, you know, you asked me to discover the internet. So,  I had no idea the internet even existed until I went to college. I, the, the thing I knew that  existed, and this is where I kind of got lucky in terms of like, as in terms of when I grew up and  when I came of age, as I came of age, sort of precisely at the moment when the PC happened.  And so, I, you know, I was aware of, you know, there were all these just like amazing stories,  you know, this is one of Steve Jobs's on the cover of Time Magazine. And, you know, so there,  there was this moment when like the personal computer hit the popular consciousness. And that  was, you know, kind of, it was sort of built in the late 70s. And then it sort of, you know,  hit, sort of catalyzed hard in the early 80s, especially around 82. And then, you know, our  school, you know, even though it was very small, started to get, you know, a handful of, of early  computers. And then there were a wave of consumer computers at that time, actually, that were  actually quite inexpensive. And so, there were computers at that time as cheap as $200 in currency  at that point, which- And this is our floppy disk. So, this is pre-hard drive or post-hard drive  when you got your first computer. Pre-floppy disk?  Tape. Cassette tape.  Cassette tape, exactly, yes.  Okay, okay. That's a slow loader, bro.  You can power to load a game. I remember that era.  Yeah. So, for people who don't remember, but before floppy disks, they were, because you  literally, you literally hook up a cassette tape player. And the thing with a cassette tape player  is it didn't have any kind of seek capability, right? And so, the way that you loaded the  program was you had to go, you had to fast forward by hand at the right point on the tape."
