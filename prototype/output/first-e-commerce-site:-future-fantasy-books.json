And they had a research lab in Palo Alto called  the DECK Western Research Lab. And there was a guy there whose name I'm blanking on, but  he I think it was Brian Reed, if I remember correctly. And he was a he was a computer science  guy there. And he was into this stuff. And there was a cult science fiction book, retail store,  tiny little hole in the wall bookstore on El Camino Real in, I think, Mountain View,  called Future Fantasy Books. And it was a cult retailer of like obscure science fiction and  fantasy novels. And it was it had, you know, it's local clientele, but it also had a lot of,  especially Japanese and German tourists, when they were in town, they would go by and they would buy  all these science fiction novels that they couldn't get back in their own countries. And so he had  this international clientele. And so this guy at DECK, I remember went and talked to the, you know,  kind of very hippie, you know, kind of, you know, ponytail old school, you know, owner of the Future  Fantasy Bookstore, and said, Oh, you know, let's put your bookstore, you know, on the internet. And  the guy's like, I have no idea what any of those words meant. Could you please explain each of  them to me in sequence? And Brian basically described, he's like, we're going to put your,  we'll create a website for you, we'll put a catalog online, and we'll let people, you know,  all these people, all these foreign buyers will be able to buy books from, you know,  Japan and Germany, they'll be able to see the catalog on the web and they can click and buy,  which was a new idea. And then, you know, you can shift to the books and your business will  grow so much. And the guys like that's great. He said, the problem is I don't, I don't actually  own a computer. And Brian's like, Well, what do you have? And he said, Well, I do have a fax  machine. And Brian said, Let me get back to you. And so the, the deck guys literally created the  future fantasy website. And they, they got, they figured out how to digitize his inventory. And  they created the first ecommerce site, at least for books, original Amazon, original, the original  Amazon. And, and then they set up a fax gateway where you would order on the web and then it would,  it would fire off a fax message to this guy's store. And then he would ship you the book. And  then of course, in sequence, you can imagine what happened next. So, so step one,  his business doubled overnight. Yeah. It's like the best thing that ever happened. And then, of  course, step two is Jeff started Amazon and then, you know, destroyed, destroyed, you know, destroyed,  destroyed, destroyed him. And you else like him. Yeah. It's like him. But there was like a year"
