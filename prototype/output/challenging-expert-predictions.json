And it's this great book, it's called  expert political judgment. And he did this comprehensive study of the he came out of  through political predictions. So basically, you know, experts showing up in, you know,  columns in the newspaper and on TV talking about like, is there going to be a war here?  You know, what's going to happen with Israel or whatever, all these predictions. And he goes  through and he basically, he basically the conclusion of it is that the sort of average,  well credentialed expert in the media on any topic, evolving sort of policy or global affairs is  somewhat less, is somewhat less than random, likely to be correct. So the credentialed experts  to score it like 40%. And a monkey flinging, you know, shit at a dartboard is like 50%.  Right, monkey. And the big thing that he points out is there's no, there are no  repercussions for being wrong. There are no, there's no career damage, there's no economic  damage, there's no nothing. And then he says the thing, if they were, if they were being,  if they were being epistemically honest, the thing that they would do is like when the talking  heads on TV talking about something, there would be a scoreboard and it would show like their last  20 predictions. And then it would have like, you know, red or green, were they right or wrong?  It's because it'd be the only way to ever have a sense of whether you're talking to somebody who  knows what they're talking about. And that scoreboard, of course, never appears. Never materialized."
