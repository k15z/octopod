    "text": " when did the kind of media and the press get wind of it? So this is a funny story. So,  so there was a Wall Street Journal reporter named Jared Sandberg. Yeah. Well, yeah, I remember  Jared Sandberg. He was a funny guy. He was a great guy is a great guy. You know, this is 30 years  ago. So we're using the was here for people who are still in perfectly good health. Great character.  Yeah. Yeah. And it wasn't as a great writer, great reporter. And so he had sort of the tech  beat at the Wall Street Journal at the time. And he figured this out early and called me up  the blue probably in, I don't know, late 92, early 93, like super early.  And he had the story ready to go. And he was intensely frustrated because he could not get  his editors to run it. Because it because it was not an important story. Yeah, of course,  Simon, you know, what are you talking about? It's just a bunch of idiot kids with bad grades  quickly writing software. Yeah. Yeah. On this internet thing that nobody cares about,  that's never going to be a thing that's about to get quashed, you know, squashed by MSN and AOL  and interactive television. And like, I tell you, again, to talk about the heresy aspect of this,  like, this is, you know, this is why I'm so distrustful of experts. Like, this is my origin  story for why I don't trust anybody with credentials. Yeah, anything anymore. So I remember  another one, like, so I was working on, I remember working, it was, it must have been,  it was like December of 92 or January 93. So I'm like working around the clock  in my little office at NCSA. And, you know, this is at Urbana Champaign is also, you know,  it's a little further south where I grew up, but it's still frozen tundra most of the year.  And the wind comes whipping over the Illinois plains and everything is frozen. And, you know,  you're slipping fall every 10 feet, you know, in the middle of winter, and just this kind of  crazy thing. And I'd be working in the middle of the night, none of the restaurants are open,  and I'd be, you know, I get hungry. And so I walked out of the one convenience store that was open  24 hours and I'd buy my whatever my hot dog or my cookies and something to drink. And I remember  walking in one night and there was this new magazine on the newsstand called Wired.  And it was Wired issue number one. Yeah. And I was like, Oh, that's interesting,  you know, it's, you know, it's a magazine about this. It appears to be a magazine that's about  things that I'm interested in, which is novel, novel concept at the time. And so I bought it and  I took it back to my office and I read it cover to cover and they did not have the word Internet  in it once. Yeah. And I was like, Okay, you know, it was like, Okay, like, I guess I don't  count, you know, I guess, I guess, I, you know, I don't count, we don't count this whole thing  doesn't count. You know, these are the experts, like they have a magazine, or pros, you know,  these. Yeah, these are the pros. And like, you know, what we're working on is clearly not important  enough to mirror the magazine. And so I was just like, Okay, I guess we're just going to keep working  on our thing. But like, you know, it's sort of like this constant message from the media, which  is like, This is not important. This is not important. This is not important. So anyway,  so Jared had this whole story is ready to go. And, and he could not get his editors to run it.  And then later in 93, John Markoff at the New York Times figured this out. And he was"
