    "description": "The evolution of closed proprietary networks such as AOL, CompuServe, and Prodigy in the 80s to interconnected open systems like the internet was discussed. These networks required approval and payment for content hosting, unlike the open structure of the internet which allowed for unrestricted participation and content sharing.",

    "text": " Yeah, so there were serious efforts underway. You alluded to this, but there were serious  efforts at the time. So let's just itemize the efforts. And so there were three, basically,  consumer online services that came out of the 80s, AOL, CompuServe and Prodigy.  AOL became famous later, much, much larger. CompuServe kind of petered out at one point.  Prodigy was actually an IBM joint venture, so they were actually kind of clued into that part  of it early. And then those systems existed in the early 90s. And those were all these  sort of proprietary stovepipes not interconnected, not open. These are by definition closed systems.  And for people who don't remember this, if you wanted to put content up on AOL,  you had to pay AOL. And you had to get their permission, their approval, and they could take  it down. And so it was sort of any of these stovepipe proprietary things, somebody really  is in charge. And the internet is the opposite of that. And so those systems ran like that.  And then there were a set of companies that then you're alluding to that we're going to do the  leapfrog on that and kind of do the modern gooey version of that. And that was specifically  Microsoft with MSN. The time was called MSN. And then Apple had something at the time called eWorld.  And then who else was running around a whole bunch of these other companies were running. And then  the media companies were doing these proprietary video interaction TV things that would also be  centralized controlled. But yeah, in particular, I think probably at the time it was really that  the big ones would have been AOL getting really big. It would have been  Microsoft establishing its own kind of permanent proprietary online service  as an alternative to the internet. And then it would have been probably Apple with its own"
