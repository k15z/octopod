    "description": "The podcast detailed the early 90s era when three online efforts, Gopher, Waze, and the World Wide Web, were in competition to revolutionize user interfaces on the internet. Each had its unique approach, with the World Wide Web introducing the concept of hypertext to link documents, laying the foundation for modern web browsing experiences.",

And so, and it was famously, it was three of them,  there was one called Gopher, there was one called Waze, and then there was the World Wide Web.  Tim Berners-Lee. And so, and these were in the very beginning, these were actually in a real  bake off with each other, there were a lot of people who had different opinions about which  of these we're going to win. Gopher was actually based on the user interfaces of the BBS system  in the 80s. And so, it was a it was a menuing system. And so, you could go down all these  different menus and download content and so forth. And then Waze, W-A-I-S, I think it was called  Wide Area Internet Search, Waze was like a pre-Google search engine. And so, sort of the idea  that you would have, you know, type in search keywords and get back results. And then this  guy, Tim Berners-Lee, in Switzerland, an English guy working at CERN in Switzerland,  had this kind of really, at the time, radical idea, which was to take an old idea called hypertext  and bring it onto the internet and basically be able to have documents that can link the point  to other documents. And this is an idea that goes back to the 50s, a guy named Doug Engelbart and  another guy Ted Nelson, you know, had kind of conceived this idea decades earlier, but the  computer systems in the 50s, 60s were not quite capable of doing it yet. And so, Tim basically  said, he was sitting at CERN, kind of doing related kinds of work that, you know, he was working in  kind of support of the physicists at CERN in the same way that I was working in support of the  physicists at Illinois. So, kind of a similar universe. And, you know, he had this idea basically,  okay, we're going to put hypertext, we're going to put hypertext on the internet in the form of the  web. But I would describe this at the time as all three of these were like very, I would say,  nascent experimental efforts. And then really critically, all three were text-based. And again,  the assumption here was the internet basically is the assumption was the internet slow, which for  most people at that time it was. And so, the assumption was the internet slow, your computer  slow, your network connection is slow. And so, Gopher was, you know, literally text, text-based  menus. Waze was type in a text keyword and then get back text results. And then the web was"
