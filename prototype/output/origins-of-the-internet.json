    "description": "The podcast traces the origins of the internet back to the late 1960s with the development of packet-switched networks, a concept pioneered by the defense department. It mentions the role of Paul Baran, an influential figure in the creation of this peer-to-peer communication system. Baran's background as an immigrant and his early work in computer science, particularly character recognition and AI, are highlighted as significant contributions to the internet's foundation.",

    "text": " the AI discussion. Maybe if I could, maybe I could go back in history now to kind of where  the internet came from. Yeah. Yeah. Go back to like the late sixties. Yeah. So, so the idea,  the internet was sort of famously this idea of what was called a packet switch network, right?  So the, the reason the internet works is because it's this peer to peer system in which computer,  you know, anybody can kind of plug a computer into the internet and then you kind of have messages  that are able to go around and, and route. Um, and so, you know, famously this is an idea that  actually was developed originally by the defense department in the 1960s, uh, uh, called packet  switching. Um, and, and in particular, there's a guy, uh, Paul Baran, um, who's kind of the original,  you know, kind of true founding father, you know, godfather of the, of this idea. Um, uh,  and actually he's, he's a great, he's a great story on this, um, going back to your silver spoon thing.  So, uh, he was born, uh, he's a, uh, he was a Jewish, uh, Jewish Polish immigrant to the U.S.  And so his parents, uh, came, brought him as a small child of the U.S. in the 1920s. Um,  is sort of classic American immigrant success story. His father opened a grocery store, um,  and then was able to make enough money to send his kid to college. Uh, Baran, you know, was a  super genius. He got an engineering degree and then he actually went to your alma mater. He went to  UCLA, uh, for a master's degree, which he got in 1959 in computer science. Um, by the way,  his master's degree in 1959 in computer science was on character recognition.  Oh, amazing. Yeah.  And so, yeah, so like he was actually, so it's like he tried to do AI first. Um, and you know,  he was early on that. Yeah. You know, it, uh, you know, he got part way there, but, um, uh,  you know, he was already at that point trying to do AI. Um, and then he went, he went to work for  the Rand Corporation, which did a lot of work for the Defense Department on military, uh,  you know, kind of strategy topics. Um, and there was a huge, this is the height of the Cold War.  So this is in the early 60s, Cuban Missile Crisis, you know, where there was a real feeling that,  you know, there might be nuclear war at any moment. And one of the big concerns the Defense  Department had was in a nuclear strike, the way telecom systems worked at that point is if you  took out the central office, you took out an entire telecom network. And so the, the fear of  the Defense Department was the Soviets presumably knew where the central switching offices were  for like the AT&T network. And so they would bomb those, you know, in a nuclear strike.  And then basically what would happen is the US would lose command and control of its nuclear  weapons. Um, and so basically it was a way, it was, the fear was it was a way for the Soviets to do  a decap, what they called a decapitation strike. They take out the central switching office from  AT&T and then the US can't retaliate. Yeah. Literally the US would not be able to fight,  you know, to fire its nukes because they couldn't send the commands to actually fire, fire, fire  the nukes. And so it was this existential kind of thing at the moment. And so this guy Paul Baran  said, well, what if we build a network that basically is designed for packet switch instead  of being circuit switch or everything's going through a central place for packet switch, where  the packets can flow around. And if part of the network gets bombed or destroyed or taken offline  or, you know, power cut or whatever, you know, the network kind of reallocates. And the significance  of this idea is not just that it led to the internet. The other significance is AT&T thought  it was the craziest idea they'd ever heard. Yeah, yeah. Right, right. Because you need control.  You need control and control. There's no central control.  Yeah, yeah. And I was reading, I just before this, I was refreshing myself and I read Paul  Baran's obituary in the New York Times and Vince Turf has quoted in the obituary saying that, you  know, Paul Baran was basically a laughed out of AT&T when he proposed this idea.  Right. Because it was such a heretical idea. So anyway, so the point being is the internet  was a heretical idea from the very beginning. And I thought in both in that it would never work  because it'd be like entirely too slow and the packet reassembly and all that would never work.  And then also that it was a dumb idea because of course, you want central control. So like,"
