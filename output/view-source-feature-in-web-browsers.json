You didn't have to be a computer scientist,  networking expert to, to build a web server. Yeah, that's right. And the experience people  had, you know, the killer, the killer kind of version of this that ended up working really  well was this idea of view source. Yeah. And so there was this feature built that we built into  mosaic and it was built into browsers, which was, I forget exactly when it popped up, but  view source, the idea basically was you're looking at, you're looking at a web page,  you're looking at the rendered version of a web page, but you could click on view source and  it would show you the HTML source code for the page. And so anytime you wanted to see how a  web page had been created to accomplish something that you wanted to do, you could just look at it  and then it made it easy to learn and replicate. Yeah. And again, that, that, that was like, that  was not, that was like, I'm afraid there was no, there was no view source for like network  protocols before that. That was like, that was a new idea. That created so many web design jobs.  It was crazy. Like, which could never have come about, you know, like that little,  or a seemingly small thing was a massive thing. Yeah. No, look, I, I meet people, I met people,  I met, I met, I met somebody just the other day who, you know, literally it's like that. It's like,  you know, they, they, they, they first got, you know, their first got access to the browser and,  you know, from their, you know, in high school or whatever and college and then they literally,  they literally do the view source thing and they're like, oh, I can write HTML and then they  got a job as a web designer. Yeah. And then that paid their way through, you know, whatever to,"
