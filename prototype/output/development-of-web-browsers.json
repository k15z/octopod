    "text": " group of us at NCSA basically kind of wet rogue in 1991 and, you know, started kind of working on  this idea on nights and weekends. And in particular, my partner at the time, Eric Bina and myself,  you know, we were the first two to kind of work on this. And just a full, full kind of  acknowledgement here. Eric and I co-wrote the first version of Mosaic, which was for UNIX work  stations. And then we had other colleagues who, you know, who are, you know, very famous in the  history, who developed the Windows version and developed the Mac version. And so, you know,  we did develop for all three, three of those platforms. But the first version was the UNIX  version. Eric and I built it. I always, I always credit it as I did the front end and then Eric  did all the hard work. Yeah, yeah, great programmer, I guess, yeah. He was fantastic, absolutely outstanding  programmer is an outstanding programmer. And, and so I did the UI and Eric did the rendering engine.  And so Eric built, or the rendering engine is the core of it, like the rendering engine is the  thing that actually renders the page and has all the user interface elements and makes the links  work and displays the images and all this stuff. And that was, that was definitely the harder,  the harder half of it from a programming standpoint. So I give Eric, you know, I give Eric  like at least half the credit, if not more for that. And then, and then my role was, was the front  end. So it's kind of everything around the rendering engine. And so it was the rest of the UI. And  then it was the other network, you know, the net, I did the networking protocols. And all the user,  everything user preferences and all the cash, you know, sort of caching and all the, all the  things to kind of make the rendering engine work. So as the two of us, and it was really like the  core work was sort of a crash, renegade project, kind of off books. And for me, it was like off  books in two ways. It was not what I was supposed to be doing at work, but it was also I was doing  this instead of going to class. So this is when I almost got kicked out of college also. Yeah,  so we sort of a crash course over the course of I guess the fourth quarter of 92. And then the,  you know, we kind of worked really hard over the holiday break in 92 to kind of get it working."
