And so my race, that's the become  the most practical idea. That works really well. So the first TV show that used that technique was  called the Star Wars show, the Mandalorian, which is a huge success. And if you watch the Mandalorian,  it's actually really, they did a great job on it. If you watch it, it seems like they're outside  all the time. And they're not the most of that most of that series was filmed when it seems like  they're outside. That was filmed in a very small sound stage in an environment with giant  LCD displays on all sides. And then with all this software is the control software they have,  where they could literally shift the perspective of the of the like the background scenes  to match like the motions of the actors and they'd have like they have overhead lights so they can  like replicate the sun or like sunset. And so actually, so anyway, so that cave idea in 1992  actually is now a state of the art in Hollywood.
