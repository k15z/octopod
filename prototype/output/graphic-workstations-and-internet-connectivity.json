    "description": "The discussion touched upon the significance of Unix workstations, particularly those at IBM in Austin, which were designed for internet connectivity. These workstations, despite their high cost, brought internet networking capabilities to users at a time when internet usage was still in its nascent stages.",

    "text": " and then my sophomore year, I spent nine months actually as a co-op student working for IBM  in Austin. And I worked on the workstations at the time, which was again, very helpful for this,  because these were kind of the leading edge user interface, you know, so like I worked on graphics  systems. And they had TCPIP, right? The workstations, yeah. They were built in. And then IBM in Austin  at the time, you know, this is when IBM was on top of the world, it was, you know, by far the most  important tech company still at that point. And, you know, we had this, we had a 6,000 person  division in Austin working on these Unix workstations at the time, graphical workstations. And again,  they had the resources, everybody there was also wired, everybody was on the internet,  these workstations were designed to be used on the internet. Right. And I was at the time did not  have any internet capability. You know, there was no, in the early 90s, there was no TCPIP,  there was never none of it. Yeah, well, computers, you recall this, yeah, computers,  PCs and Macs up until 93, 94, didn't even come with TCPIP built into the computer,  built into the operating system. Right. We had to actually, you actually had to buy it,  what was called the TCPIP stack is a separate thing. Windsock. Windsock and these things.  And so yeah, but the Unix workstations of that era, you know, the problem with the Unix workstations  is they cost like $50,000. And so these were not consumer products. But if you had one, you had  internet networking built into it. And then if you were at IBM, like I was, or at Illinois,"
