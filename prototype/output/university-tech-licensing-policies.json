    "description": "The discussion touches on the differing approaches universities take towards technology licensing. It contrasts the University of Illinois' actions with the more supportive stances of institutions like Stanford and MIT. The podcast suggests that nurturing successful ventures stemming from university projects may yield greater returns through philanthropy compared to strict technology licensing fees.",

    "text": " retrospect, that was sort of the crack, you know, we sort of introduced a crack in the armor  from the very beginning by doing that. And then basically what happened was, as, as, as I was  leaving moving to California, the other people at Illinois started to figure out that there was  actually, you know, they got access to the commercial mailbox that had all the commercial  inbound licensing requests. And so they started to get a sense that there might be money in it.  And so the founders of this, that company, Spyglass, I mentioned, which was like the one  software company in Champaign Urbana actually approached, without me having any awareness  of this, they approached the University of Illinois administration. And they basically  struck a deal to license the Mosaic, our code to license the Mosaic software code that we had  written for commercial sales. And they started offering a commercial product called Spyglass  Mosaic, you know, and, you know, totally within rights of the university to do this and with  Spyglass to do this, and that deal was great. And off they went. But, but then we, we then  announced Netscape. And of course, we were the team that had written all that code. And then this  started to become, you know, by now, the press has started to take it seriously. So we started  to become, you know, famous and well known and Clark was this legend. And so we started to get  all this press coverage. And so Spyglass started to get really worried that we were going to, you  know, snuff them, you know, and we were going to laugh them with the product. And so Spyglass  enlisted the administration of the University of Illinois to basically try to kill us.  And the form of the form, the form of the murder attempt was to,  they didn't receive, they didn't sue us. And they didn't sue us because they didn't have a good  claim because like we weren't actually violating copyright and, you know, the trademark, you  could change the name. So they didn't actually have like a good legal case to sue us. And so  instead of suing us, what they did instead was they called Spyglass, any situation we were in  where we were competing with Spyglass for a sale, they, the University of Illinois administrators  would call the customer and tell them that they were going to sue us. Good Lord. That's a thing  to do to a startup. That's like the dirtiest thing you can do to a startup. It's just like a super  nefarious, you know, you know, because like who wants to, you know, any big company doesn't, you  know, is already kind of, you know, worried about doing business with the startup to start with.  And if the startup is literally about to get sued, like why, why take the risk?  And so our whole sales pipeline froze up. And, you know, we're running on, you know,  we're running a venture capital and like, you know, money's getting, you know, and so like we  don't have that, you know, not, you know, VC wasn't in those days, what it is today, we didn't have  that long of a runway. And so we needed revenue. And, and so this, this became a big problem. And  so we kind of got everybody together and talked about it. And so we then decide, and I'm very  proud of this decision, we preemptively sued the University of Illinois on this case. And we  sued them for, you know, certain interference of trade. There's these, there's these sort of laws  that are not great laws to sue on, but they worked in this case, which is this thing called  torturous interference. You can kind of, you can, in theory, they're, in theory, it's illegal to  like just gratuitously interfere in somebody else's business, try to unhook other people's contracts.  It's not great law, it doesn't often get enforced, but like at least it is on the books. And so we  sued Illinois. They, and a furious negotiation followed. We offered them at the time $4 million  worth of stock in the company, when the company was worth, I don't know, 20 million or something.  And most of you youngsters eventually sold for 10 billion. So you can do that.  Yeah. Yeah. So it was, yeah, it was a bill, you know, it was a billion plus, or, you know,  some depending on exactly what, but you know, but it would have been, it would have been a lot of  money. And they turned that down. And instead they demanded cash. And so you didn't have,  we didn't, we didn't have, although, you know, we, we, we, at that point, it was starting to work.  And so we raised money from Kleiner Perkins and we had other investor interests. And so we, we,  and we had sales, you know, starting to come in. And so we, we, we, we paid them the cash and did  the settlement and, and got them off our backs. Yeah, that decision on their part, yeah, cost  them at least a billion dollars in direct stock, plus all the downstream philanthropy from me,  plus, plus all the downstream philanthropy from Jim Clark, plus all the other founding engineers.  They lost a few buildings, I would thank, yeah. They lost, I think, a campus. Yeah.  You know, I'm going to, I'm just going to speculate they lost probably three billion dollars in,  you know, 1990s dollars. Yeah. With that decision. Now, again, this is why I gave the disclaimer  up front, like, you know, look, like the alternate universe, Mark, with a different skill set would  have, would have had a very different way of dealing with this. Yeah. But like, Mark, as he  actually existed on earth one, like, I never met the University of Illinois administrators, like,  I didn't, you know, I didn't know the president of the university. Yeah. I'm like a random undergrad,  right. And so like, I didn't know the president of the university, you know, I could have called him.  Yeah, that's true. That's true. Although it's still like, you know, the calculus that they  made, but it's a bureaucracy to, to harass their own students and side with like somebody who wrote  them a check is still a little on the evil side, I would say. Yeah. I thought it was really bad.  I get really upset. I was really upset for a long time. To be totally honest, I'm still upset.  Every, every subsequent administration, every subsequent new administration at the university  has attempted to reach out and repair the bridge. I have not returned the calls.  Yeah, no, you're a grudge holder. You and my biggest grudge holders I know.  I greatly value my grudges. They're very important to me.  So, yeah, so, yeah, and, you know, the broader point, Ben, that you brought up is really key,  which is like, look, there are a small number of universities in the world that, and you'd put  certainly Stanford in this category and MIT and a bunch of others. But, you know, there's a certain  number of them that really understand, and this is maybe Stanford's great genius over the last 50  years as an institution is you kind of understand that it's actually really good. If this kind of  thing happens, like if your students or even your faculty, you know, go off and do something new and  are successful in business, and then the, you know, the, you know, the money that you'll get,  the money that you'll get back in philanthropy is going to be orders of magnitude higher than  whatever technology licensing fee you could extract or whatever threat you, you could extort  people, you know, money you could extort people out of or whatever. Well, it goes back to the  original mosaics or, you know, like, it seems like you're giving a lot up by being open, but,  you know, you're you're actually opening the whole world to you. And it's actually a great metaphor  for life, which is, you know, if you live in abundance, you will get abundance. And if you  live in scarcity, you'll screw yourself. And good that those universities are abundant. And  it's good that you are abundant with the internet. And that's how we live in the world we are in  today. So what an amazing. Yeah, I often think about the alternate universe, if, you know,  if you don't write mosaic, if it doesn't work, if you don't start Netscape like  it does seem like we would have had an elect most systems or many systems are proprietary,  right? Like the smartphones are, you know, everybody pays the tax to download their app from  the app store, because Apple owns that it's not open. And, you know,  you know, Google is an extremely powerful company, because, you know, if you want to  search something, that's where you have to go and so forth. And these, you know, it's just such  an amazing anomaly in the industry that the internet happened, and that anybody could join  and anybody could put up a website and anybody could build a great business. And, you know,"
