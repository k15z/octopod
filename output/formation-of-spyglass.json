    "text": " And so the founders of this, that company, Spyglass, I mentioned, which was like the one  software company in Champaign Urbana actually approached, without me having any awareness  of this, they approached the University of Illinois administration. And they basically  struck a deal to license the Mosaic, our code to license the Mosaic software code that we had  written for commercial sales. And they started offering a commercial product called Spyglass  Mosaic, you know, and, you know, totally within rights of the university to do this and with  Spyglass to do this, and that deal was great. And off they went. But, but then we, we then  announced Netscape. And of course, we were the team that had written all that code. And then this  started to become, you know, by now, the press has started to take it seriously. So we started  to become, you know, famous and well known and Clark was this legend. And so we started to get  all this press coverage. And so Spyglass started to get really worried that we were going to, you  know, snuff them, you know, and we were going to laugh them with the product. And so Spyglass  enlisted the administration of the University of Illinois to basically try to kill us.  And the form of the form, the form of the murder attempt was to,  they didn't receive, they didn't sue us. And they didn't sue us because they didn't have a good  claim because like we weren't actually violating copyright and, you know, the trademark, you  could change the name. So they didn't actually have like a good legal case to sue us. And so  instead of suing us, what they did instead was they called Spyglass, any situation we were in  where we were competing with Spyglass for a sale, they, the University of Illinois administrators  would call the customer and tell them that they were going to sue us. Good Lord. That's a thing  to do to a startup. That's like the dirtiest thing you can do to a startup. It's just like a super  nefarious, you know, you know, because like who wants to, you know, any big company doesn't, you  know, is already kind of, you know, worried about doing business with the startup to start with.  And if the startup is literally about to get sued, like why, why take the risk?  And so our whole sales pipeline froze up. And, you know, we're running on, you know,  we're running a venture capital and like, you know, money's getting, you know, and so like we  don't have that, you know, not, you know, VC wasn't in those days, what it is today, we didn't have  that long of a runway. And so we needed revenue. And, and so this, this became a big problem. And  so we kind of got everybody together and talked about it. And so we then decide, and I'm very  proud of this decision, we preemptively sued the University of Illinois on this case. And we  sued them for, you know, certain interference of trade. There's these, there's these sort of laws  that are not great laws to sue on, but they worked in this case, which is this thing called  torturous interference. You can kind of, you can, in theory, they're, in theory, it's illegal to  like just gratuitously interfere in somebody else's business, try to unhook other people's contracts.  It's not great law, it doesn't often get enforced, but like at least it is on the books. And so we  sued Illinois. They, and a furious negotiation followed. We offered them at the time $4 million  worth of stock in the company, when the company was worth, I don't know, 20 million or something.  And most of you youngsters eventually sold for 10 billion. So you can do that.  Yeah. Yeah. So it was, yeah, it was a bill, you know, it was a billion plus, or, you know,  some depending on exactly what, but you know, but it would have been, it would have been a lot of  money. And they turned that down. And instead they demanded cash. And so you didn't have,  we didn't, we didn't have, although, you know, we, we, we, at that point, it was starting to work.  And so we raised money from Kleiner Perkins and we had other investor interests. And so we, we,  and we had sales, you know, starting to come in. And so we, we, we, we paid them the cash and did  the settlement and, and got them off our backs. Yeah, that decision on their part, yeah, cost"
