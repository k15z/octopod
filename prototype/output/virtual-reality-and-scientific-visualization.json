    "description": "The podcast explored the early endeavors in virtual reality (VR) and scientific visualization, particularly focusing on projects related to rendering scientific simulations into visual forms using supercomputers. The mention of the 'cave' concept, an alternate vision of VR with physical spaces and giant monitors, highlighted the innovative approaches to immersive experiences even during the early 90s.",

    "text": " early work in VR at the time, because there was this whole focus, oh, there was this whole focus  on what was at the time called scientific visualization. And this is sort of what later  became like special effects in movies. But this was actually pre Jurassic Park and pre Terminator 2.  And so the idea was to like, you know, the supercomputers would do these like black hole  simulations or weather simulations or something. And then you could actually use these graphical  workstations to actually render movies. And you could actually show scientific results in visual  form. And so the group did a lot of that. Actually, those guys actually, a lot of those guys actually  went on and actually ultimately then created the computer graphics industry in both the computer  industry and then also in the in the in film and television. So that was also a thing that was"
