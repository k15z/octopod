    "description": "The podcast elaborates on the significant role played by the early web browsers like Mosaic in driving the growth of the internet. It touches upon how Mosaic became widely used, prompting more internet users to come online at home. This expansion led to the boom of consumer ISPs and the upgrade of PCs to support graphical interfaces and networking capabilities.",

    "text": " it and I created the image tag. Yeah. And people put up images.  Yes, I won though. What's the, I won the, I won, I won the de facto argument just through,  through sheer authoritarian action. Yeah, you were a king of the internet. And then as well,  tell us about like, okay, how did it take off? When did the press recognize it? And then  how did you become go from king of the internet to customer support for the entire internet?  It's the same thing. It's the same thing.  Also the main, the main blogger, maybe the first blogger, depending on how you score it. So  it was also the sort of, I was the front page for a while. So, yeah, so we started basically a  group of us at NCSA basically kind of wet rogue in 1991 and, you know, started kind of working on  this idea on nights and weekends. And in particular, my partner at the time, Eric Bina and myself,  you know, we were the first two to kind of work on this. And just a full, full kind of  acknowledgement here. Eric and I co-wrote the first version of Mosaic, which was for UNIX work  stations. And then we had other colleagues who, you know, who are, you know, very famous in the  history, who developed the Windows version and developed the Mac version. And so, you know,  we did develop for all three, three of those platforms. But the first version was the UNIX  version. Eric and I built it. I always, I always credit it as I did the front end and then Eric  did all the hard work. Yeah, yeah, great programmer, I guess, yeah. He was fantastic, absolutely outstanding  programmer is an outstanding programmer. And, and so I did the UI and Eric did the rendering engine.  And so Eric built, or the rendering engine is the core of it, like the rendering engine is the  thing that actually renders the page and has all the user interface elements and makes the links  work and displays the images and all this stuff. And that was, that was definitely the harder,  the harder half of it from a programming standpoint. So I give Eric, you know, I give Eric  like at least half the credit, if not more for that. And then, and then my role was, was the front  end. So it's kind of everything around the rendering engine. And so it was the rest of the UI. And  then it was the other network, you know, the net, I did the networking protocols. And all the user,  everything user preferences and all the cash, you know, sort of caching and all the, all the  things to kind of make the rendering engine work. So as the two of us, and it was really like the  core work was sort of a crash, renegade project, kind of off books. And for me, it was like off  books in two ways. It was not what I was supposed to be doing at work, but it was also I was doing  this instead of going to class. So this is when I almost got kicked out of college also. Yeah,  so we sort of a crash course over the course of I guess the fourth quarter of 92. And then the,  you know, we kind of worked really hard over the holiday break in 92 to kind of get it working.  And then I forget the exact sequence, but we put out the first kind of acceptable version,  which I think was the 0.9 version. And like around Christmas or a little bit after 92. And  then I think got to quote 1.0 and kind of the spring of 93. And yeah, and basically it went  vertical, basically out of the gate with the 0.9 version. So it was basically a, yeah, so sort of  a sort of a year of preparatory work in 92. And then it was sort of 93 was the vertical takeoff.  And 93 was a very important year for me because it was my senior year in college,  also. And so, and I was off a semester, I was off cycle by a semester for reasons. And then,  and so anyway, so, so January to December 93 were my, that was my senior year in college.  And so this was like my chance to like really do that. And then, because I just assumed I was  going to graduate and, you know, leave and get a job at the end of the year. So I had about a  12 month run there where the thing really took off. And then, yeah, look, it was the tiger. Oh,  and then we had other colleagues who did the, did the, what was the, not the first web server,  but the first kind of widely used, I would say robust scalable web server. And again, that also  again, gave us a lot of ability to move quickly because we can, we actually controlled for,  for that period, we controlled both the client and the server. And so we can move very fast.  Yeah, so that, yeah, so the two of them came out. And then, and then people started to figure  this out and it started to get, you know, widely used among existing internet users. And then,  and then it was an immediate reason for people to get online at home. And it was really the first  reason for a lot of people to try to get online at home. And so it also, I think, helped catalyze  the boom and what we're called at the time, consumer ISPs, and for people to upgrade their  PCs to be graphical and then have network, you know, have the network stack. And so the 93 was  like this upward, you know, the straight kind of upward hurricane. But again, it was in this context  of we're working for a research institute funded by the federal government.  And so, you know, we have, you know, we have no money, we have no revenue, we have no business  model, you know, if we got a product out there, that's taken off, it's taken off like crazy. And  then we put it out as open source, but under what's what is called a hybrid license, we put it  on under a hybrid license that says it's free for it's all free for academic and individual use  and profit use. But if you want to use it for commercial applications, you have to come talk  to us. And then, and then I had the I had the mailbox for the incoming commercial queries.  And I remember when it hit like 400 of basic of basic companies, you know, like general  councils and procurement officers at big companies saying, you know, we want to deploy this  throughout our company, you know, who do we pay? And we had no way to take the money. We didn't  even have like a price sheet. We didn't have any of this. And then very critically, we didn't have  any support, right? So we didn't have any customer support resources. And so we had the support"
