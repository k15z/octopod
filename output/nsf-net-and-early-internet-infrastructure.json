    "title": "NSF Net and Early Internet Infrastructure",
    "description": "The creation of the NSF net, funded by the National Science Foundation, served as the first backbone of the internet. Initially designed to connect supercomputing centers, it evolved to allow researchers from universities across the country to access centralized supercomputers remotely. This early infrastructure laid the foundation for the internet as we know it today, with significant implications for research and communication.",

    "text": " So this was four years into two federal programs that basically created the, you know, basically  created the precondition for everything that followed with the internet. And the two programs  were something I think it was called the National Supercomputing Act. And it was basically this  effort to basically fund it as funded for what we're called National Supercomputing Centers  at four universities, one of which was Illinois. And so the campus there was just there was just  the federal government just dropped in a ton of money to basically buy state of the art computers,  including at the time, really big computers, like these big cray and thinking machines computers  that cost, you know, like $25 million, you know, at the time, and, you know, filled up entire rooms.  You know, the super computers in those days were so big that in some cases, you'd actually  build a building for them and you'd build the building. But you wouldn't close the roof and  you would lower the computer by a crane down through the roof into the center of the building  and then you would finish the roof. And so the big iron.  Yes, exactly. Exactly. So very esoteric, very esoteric, expensive, powerful systems.  So we had we had those. And then the other federal program was a program to build what was  called the NSF net, which is NSF there being short for National Science Foundation, which is the  government agency that the money came through. And the NSF, the NSF net basically was the first  internet backbone, as we understand it today. And the those programs were joined because the  original purpose of the NSF net was to connect together these supercomputing centers and then  to connect to allow researchers, scientists in many other colleges, universities across the country  to be able to remotely access these large centralized supercomputers."
