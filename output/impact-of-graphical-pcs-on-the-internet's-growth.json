    "description": "The podcast explored how the emergence of graphical PCs, starting with the Macintosh and Windows version three, played a crucial role in the growth of the internet. Prior to this technological advancement, graphical user interfaces were limited, hindering the development of user-friendly applications and services.",

And so the arrivals, the arrival specifically of the Macintosh, and then followed  by that the arrival of Windows, Windows version three, and the, and the first graphical PCs. And  so the, you know, before about 1992 or so, you weren't going to have a graphical user interface  to anything, because you didn't have graphical user interfaces at all. And so there was also a  moment in time thing that happened there. So there was all that. Yeah. And so then my, my part of  the story was, I was, I had a bunch of jobs in college and was getting my computer science degree.  And then I ended up working for what's called NCSA, which was the National Center for Super  Computer Applications, which was- And you're a freshman at the time or a sophomore when you got  that job? No, so I actually didn't get, I actually didn't start working there until I was a junior.  So I worked, when I was a freshman, I worked in a physics lab called the Materials Research Lab  there, which was actually a great entry point for me, because that was one of the main labs using  the big supercomputers. Yeah. And so I kind of got plugged into that world very early. And then I,  and then my sophomore year, I spent nine months actually as a co-op student working for IBM  in Austin. And I worked on the workstations at the time, which was again, very helpful for this,  because these were kind of the leading edge user interface, you know, so like I worked on graphics  systems. And they had TCPIP, right? The workstations, yeah. They were built in. And then IBM in Austin  at the time, you know, this is when IBM was on top of the world, it was, you know, by far the most  important tech company still at that point. And, you know, we had this, we had a 6,000 person  division in Austin working on these Unix workstations at the time, graphical workstations. And again,  they had the resources, everybody there was also wired, everybody was on the internet,  these workstations were designed to be used on the internet. Right. And I was at the time did not  have any internet capability. You know, there was no, in the early 90s, there was no TCPIP,  there was never none of it. Yeah, well, computers, you recall this, yeah, computers,  PCs and Macs up until 93, 94, didn't even come with TCPIP built into the computer,  built into the operating system. Right. We had to actually, you actually had to buy it,  what was called the TCPIP stack is a separate thing. Windsock. Windsock and these things."
