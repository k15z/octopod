    "description": "The episode explores the origins of Netscape, initially named Mosaic, and the recruitment of the original Mosaic team. It details the transition from a federal research-funded non-commercial project at the University of Illinois to the establishment of Netscape in California. The naming controversy surrounding Mosaic's source code release is also highlighted.",

    "text": " So you started Netscape with Jim Clark. It was actually called Mosaic, right at the time.  Yeah. So, so we, so we, you know, again, I had graduated. We, you know, the other people,  the other, you know, the other, our other colleagues at Illinois were, you know, working  either they were either students or staff members there. Everybody was working under  federal research funding on a specifically non-commercial project, you know, which was open  source, you know, there's, and so, you know, like I said, there was no, you know, there was no,  the university didn't have, there was no commercial, anything, you know, of value, at least according  to what everybody thought at the time. And so we start Netscape. We actually go out, Jim and I  actually flew back out to Urbana in the middle, and there was still an incredible snowstorm,  and hired, you know, I think basically all but one, I think, of the original Mosaic team members  to join us in Netscape. So that was the original thing. Most of them were able to move out to  California and were core members of what followed at Netscape. And so, and then we booted up the  company. We, and then we named it Mosaic, and that was sort of the first issue that got us in  trouble. And I should say the reason we named it Mosaic was not because we planned to literally  like offer Mosaic as a product. We very specifically decided we were going to leave the source code  behind. You wrote it like when you were skipping class. Yes. We knew it was not a commercial,  we knew it was not commercial grade. We knew it had all, you know, just had, it had just issues,  it had issue performance issues, it had, you know, you just, you create one of these things,  you know all the issues. And so we just knew it had all these issues. And so we knew we needed to  start from, we wanted to start from scratch and build kind of the correct commercial product.  And we knew what we needed to do to do that. And so we very specifically did not bring the  source code with us. But, you know, all the standard HTML and HTTP and all these standards  were open, open standards, and they were all free to, you know, people on the internet were able  to use them and do whatever they wanted. So, so we're like, okay, we have no like, we have no  copyright issues here. You know, we're not taking the code. And then on the, on the trademark side,  you know, we, there's a long history and Silicon Valley of companies that are sort of named after  the projects that spawn them, often out of a university setting, or some other setting. And  so there were two, two famous examples, Sun Micro, Sun Microsystems at the time, which was,  you know, a huge, a huge successful company. The name Sun actually came from the project  at Stanford, which was Stanford University Network, SUN. And so that was like the name of  that company was like an homage to the Stanford environment that those guys came out of. And  then Oracle was the code name of a project that Larry Ellison had done for the government in  the 1970s. Right. And so there was this like, what I thought at the time was like a time-honored  tradition of like, you can basically use the name as an homage. And, you know, Illinois does,  they don't have a commercial, you know, interest in this. And so what we'll just do it. But in  retrospect, that was sort of the crack, you know, we sort of introduced a crack in the armor  from the very beginning by doing that. And then basically what happened was, as, as, as I was  leaving moving to California, the other people at Illinois started to figure out that there was  actually, you know, they got access to the commercial mailbox that had all the commercial  inbound licensing requests. And so they started to get a sense that there might be money in it.  And so the founders of this, that company, Spyglass, I mentioned, which was like the one  software company in Champaign Urbana actually approached, without me having any awareness"
