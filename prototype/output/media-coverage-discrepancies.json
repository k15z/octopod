It detailed an instance where a story featuring significant developments was not covered initially by editors, indicating a lack of recognition for pioneering work. The subsequent coverage in the New York Times highlighted the challenges faced in garnering acknowledgment for innovative endeavors.",

    "text": " when did the kind of media and the press get wind of it? So this is a funny story. So,  so there was a Wall Street Journal reporter named Jared Sandberg. Yeah. Well, yeah, I remember  Jared Sandberg. He was a funny guy. He was a great guy is a great guy. You know, this is 30 years  ago. So we're using the was here for people who are still in perfectly good health. Great character.  Yeah. Yeah. And it wasn't as a great writer, great reporter. And so he had sort of the tech  beat at the Wall Street Journal at the time. And he figured this out early and called me up  the blue probably in, I don't know, late 92, early 93, like super early.  And he had the story ready to go. And he was intensely frustrated because he could not get  his editors to run it. Because it because it was not an important story. Yeah, of course,  Simon, you know, what are you talking about? It's just a bunch of idiot kids with bad grades  quickly writing software. Yeah. Yeah. On this internet thing that nobody cares about,  that's never going to be a thing that's about to get quashed, you know, squashed by MSN and AOL  and interactive television. And like, I tell you, again, to talk about the heresy aspect of this,  like, this is, you know, this is why I'm so distrustful of experts. Like, this is my origin  story for why I don't trust anybody with credentials. Yeah, anything anymore. So I remember  another one, like, so I was working on, I remember working, it was, it must have been,  it was like December of 92 or January 93. So I'm like working around the clock  in my little office at NCSA. And, you know, this is at Urbana Champaign is also, you know,  it's a little further south where I grew up, but it's still frozen tundra most of the year.  And the wind comes whipping over the Illinois plains and everything is frozen. And, you know,  you're slipping fall every 10 feet, you know, in the middle of winter, and just this kind of  crazy thing. And I'd be working in the middle of the night, none of the restaurants are open,  and I'd be, you know, I get hungry. And so I walked out of the one convenience store that was open  24 hours and I'd buy my whatever my hot dog or my cookies and something to drink. And I remember  walking in one night and there was this new magazine on the newsstand called Wired.  And it was Wired issue number one. Yeah. And I was like, Oh, that's interesting,  you know, it's, you know, it's a magazine about this. It appears to be a magazine that's about  things that I'm interested in, which is novel, novel concept at the time. And so I bought it and  I took it back to my office and I read it cover to cover and they did not have the word Internet  in it once. Yeah. And I was like, Okay, you know, it was like, Okay, like, I guess I don't  count, you know, I guess, I guess, I, you know, I don't count, we don't count this whole thing  doesn't count. You know, these are the experts, like they have a magazine, or pros, you know,  these. Yeah, these are the pros. And like, you know, what we're working on is clearly not important  enough to mirror the magazine. And so I was just like, Okay, I guess we're just going to keep working  on our thing. But like, you know, it's sort of like this constant message from the media, which  is like, This is not important. This is not important. This is not important. So anyway,  so Jared had this whole story is ready to go. And, and he could not get his editors to run it.  And then later in 93, John Markoff at the New York Times figured this out. And he was  a good tech reporter. I mean, John Markoff is a smart guy. Yeah.  Legendary, legendary, legendary, you know, tech reporter going back, you know, quite, quite a  bit, you know, still very active. But at the time, he was like a veteran and was very well  respected in the industry and wrote a bunch of good books and so forth. And so he wrote a story  for the New York Times. And so the good news is he wrote a story. The bad news is it featured  my boss and my boss's boss. Who had nothing to do with the project? Who had you work on  something entirely else? Well, my boss, my boss at the time to his credit, you know, he was aware  and he, you know, he kind of, you know, he kind of, you know, he didn't vigorously oppose us. And  then he supported us. And then he ultimately sort of adopted as a project. And so he kind of  used his way into it, but he ultimately was very supportive. And then, but my boss's boss was the  director of NCSA at the time. And look, this is one of those things where I like, I owe these guys  a tremendous amount, because they created this environment that I was able to do my work in.  And I wouldn't be here today, if not for them. But, you know, you know, I kind of, I kind of a  little bit of an iffy relationship with my boss to start with. And then I had never met my boss's  boss. Right. And there was no reason for me to meet my boss's boss, because I'm like an undergraduate  like staff member, like, you know, he's a big, like a huge, he's like a huge important researcher,  astrophysicist, and, you know, directing this huge super computing center. So he had no reason  to meet me. But, you know, the story shows of the New York Times, it's smiling photos of the two  of them and not, you know, Eric and me. And I'm like, Oh, okay, I see how this works.  And how did you feel at the time? Because I know how you would feel now if that it happens. But  like, how did you feel then? It was just a little bit, I don't know, it was a little bit,  it was a little bit annoying, but it was also a little bit of like, look, it's the New York Times,  like, I don't know, you know, I don't, I guess they write about important people, right? And  these are important people because they're running this thing. And I'm not an important person,  because I'm only writing code. And, you know, it's like the project is important enough where  they can write about the project, but like the people actually writing the code are not important  enough to talk about. And so it's like, it's kind of the same reaction I had to Wired Magazine,  which is like, it's a little bit annoying, but I guess it means I just need to go back to work,  because there's, there's nothing else to be, it's not like I can call the, it would never occur to  me to call the editor of the New York Times and complain. Nor would he have taken my call, you  know? And so, he certainly didn't know who I was, because it certainly wasn't in the story.  So, so it was, you know, it was just like, it was like whatever, but it's like this weird, you  know, it's like the Play-Doh shadows on a cave wall thing, which is just like, okay, there's this,  there's all these things that people believe, right, including up to the internet is like doomed,  and there's never going to be a thing, and it's going to get swamped and, and all these things.  And then, and then we're just like, okay, no, we just have this stuff in front of us, and it just  plainly works, and we believe in it. And I guess we're just going to keep working on it. And maybe  people will figure out maybe they want. Anyway, so Jared, Jared Samberg calls me up, I remember the  day that story broke in the New York Times, Jared Samberg calls me up, and he's just absolutely  livid. And he told me that he, he got the morning paper, and you know, this is like six months later,  something after he, you know, he would have had the scoop. He would have had the first story on  basically on all of this stuff. And he literally told me the story, he said he charged into his  office that morning and slapped the New York Times down to the desk in one of these dramatic  moments and said, you know, see, I told you so, you know, John Markov front page of the business  section, I told you this was actually a story. And his boss is like, Oh, yeah, I guess, I guess  you were right. Oh my God, that's so crazy. So that's how again, the heresy like that's how"
