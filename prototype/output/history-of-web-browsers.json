So let me just start with,  you know, Ben, I'm glad you just went through what you just went through. I totally agree. And  specifically look like this says a lot to do with the debate raging around AI right now.  Which is, you know, these big companies, you know, the big companies in those days had every  reason, you know, they had all these stories. By the way, a lot of the story the big companies  told about the internet early on was it's unsafe. And safe. And it was. And it wasn't true to that.  It was, you know, but it was literally going to be, I mean, there was an, it took a long time  for e-commerce to take off in retrospect, relative to how fast it could have taken off,  because people literally just were worried that their credit card was going to get stolen.  Like you had to get over that hump. And there was just this constant fear of like cyber crime  and this and that and then spam and abuse and like all these things. And so, and so the big  companies always had like all these reasons why they needed to have total control. And, you know,  the government needed to protect them and they needed to have all these regulations and they  needed to have, you know, they just did the world needed to be a world not of open systems,  like the internet, it needed to be a world of proprietary systems. And look, a lot of the way  the world works today is for proprietary systems, you know, the banking system is not open, right?  You know, you're, you're, you just, if the bank decides to debank you, they debank you,  or whatever it is, or if they don't want to let the money go through, they don't let the money  go through. And so, you know, most of the, most of the world, most of the economy is with these  big companies with total control. And so yeah, I think it's a, I wanted to go through that because  I think it's a, it's a, it's a major miracle when you're able to actually get one of these open  systems to work. And it's like, and then years later, you're just like, Oh my God, I can't believe  we almost had the much worse world where the big companies ran everything. But it is amazing how  the pattern keeps repeating. And it's specifically repeating again today, you know, today with AI.  Again, ironically, and to your point, ironically, some of the companies that are lobbying hardest  for regulatory capture and cartel, you know, kind of government cartel status for AI are companies  that exist today because the internet was open. And so they are engaged in a particularly advanced  form of hypocrisy and mental gymnastics. And then my prank, the founders are gone. So  yes, and taken over by the other people, the other people, although I still, I still blame  the founders. Anyway, so, so okay, so the, the, the, the climax of the story is I just can't resist  because I just think this is so amazing given what happened, what followed. So, okay, so then  we settle with Illinois, we get underway, we're shipping our products, we're starting to get  revenue, we're starting to work. This is around, I think, you know, the time you joined us was  kind of during this period. And, and, and, and so, and so, but we're competing, we're competing  with, you know, there's a bunch of other companies that are starting, you know, people figured out  that this was actually a, the internet was going to be a thing. And so a bunch of other  software companies got funded and started. And then this company, Spyglass was still out there.  And Spyglass was selling their, they were selling, Spyglass was like, they were selling our own  code against us. Yeah, right. Maddening. Yeah, it's a little frustrating. But, you know, again,  they have the legal right to do it. But like, it's a little frustrating. And it was fine. And  we're, you know, we're competing with them whatever, but it's a little bit fine. And, you  know, there's like price war going on. And, you know, we'll, you know, the sort of back and forth  going on. And then Spyglass gets this call from Microsoft. And so the Microsoft guys call Spyglass  and they're like, yeah, we want to license Spyglass Mosaic so we can build it into Windows. And the  Spyglass guys say, you know, yeah, that sounds great. You know, basically how much per, you know,  how much per copy are you going to, you know, pay us for that. And Microsoft says,  you don't understand, we're going to pay you a flat fee. You know, which is the same, you know,  which is the same, you know, the same thing that Microsoft did originally licensed DOS way back  when. And so, but Microsoft said, you know, basically, or at least my understanding was  what Microsoft said was, you know, don't worry about it, like, you know, we're going to sell it  as an add on to Windows. And, you know, so we'll have like Microsoft, you know, Mosaic, and then  you'll still have Spyglass Mosaic and you can sell it on, you know, other operating systems or compete  with us or whatever, do whatever you want. And so they struck the deal. I think it was like a  million dollar one time payment. And the Spyglass guys thought they had struck gold because they  had this like massive endorsement, you know, the big blow to us because we didn't get the Microsoft  deal. And then they were going to, you know, sort of, you know, the whole industry is going to  benefit from this. And then they're going to go out and sell lots of other versions of Spyglass  Mosaic. And then there was this press Microsoft had the press conference where they originally  announced Internet Explorer, their browser, which was Spyglass Mosaic, again, our code,  relabeled. And there's a famous, famous moment where the Microsoft guys are on stage and they're  and then they do that, you know, the one more thing part. And oh, by the way, we're going to make it  free. There's a famous moment, you know, the Spyglass CEO with his head in his hands in the  front row, you know, of the press conference, you know, realizing that his business had just"
