So the, the reason the internet works is because it's this peer to peer system in which computer,  you know, anybody can kind of plug a computer into the internet and then you kind of have messages  that are able to go around and, and route. Um, and so, you know, famously this is an idea that  actually was developed originally by the defense department in the 1960s, uh, uh, called packet  switching. Um, and, and in particular, there's a guy, uh, Paul Baran, um, who's kind of the original,  you know, kind of true founding father, you know, godfather of the, of this idea. Um, uh,  and actually he's, he's a great, he's a great story on this, um, going back to your silver spoon thing.  So, uh, he was born, uh, he's a, uh, he was a Jewish, uh, Jewish Polish immigrant to the U.S.  And so his parents, uh, came, brought him as a small child of the U.S. in the 1920s. Um,  is sort of classic American immigrant success story. His father opened a grocery store, um,  and then was able to make enough money to send his kid to college. Uh, Baran, you know, was a  super genius. He got an engineering degree and then he actually went to your alma mater. He went to  UCLA, uh, for a master's degree, which he got in 1959 in computer science. Um, by the way,  his master's degree in 1959 in computer science was on character recognition.  Oh, amazing. Yeah.  And so, yeah, so like he was actually, so it's like he tried to do AI first. Um, and you know,  he was early on that. Yeah. You know, it, uh, you know, he got part way there, but, um, uh,  you know, he was already at that point trying to do AI. Um, and then he went, he went to work for  the Rand Corporation, which did a lot of work for the Defense Department on military, uh,  you know, kind of strategy topics. Um, and there was a huge, this is the height of the Cold War.  So this is in the early 60s, Cuban Missile Crisis, you know, where there was a real feeling that,  you know, there might be nuclear war at any moment. And one of the big concerns the Defense  Department had was in a nuclear strike, the way telecom systems worked at that point is if you  took out the central office, you took out an entire telecom network. And so the, the fear of  the Defense Department was the Soviets presumably knew where the central switching offices were  for like the AT&T network. And so they would bomb those, you know, in a nuclear strike.  And then basically what would happen is the US would lose command and control of its nuclear  weapons. Um, and so basically it was a way, it was, the fear was it was a way for the Soviets to do  a decap, what they called a decapitation strike. They take out the central switching office from  AT&T and then the US can't retaliate. Yeah. Literally the US would not be able to fight,  you know, to fire its nukes because they couldn't send the commands to actually fire, fire, fire  the nukes. And so it was this existential kind of thing at the moment. And so this guy Paul Baran  said, well, what if we build a network that basically is designed for packet switch instead  of being circuit switch or everything's going through a central place for packet switch, where  the packets can flow around. And if part of the network gets bombed or destroyed or taken offline  or, you know, power cut or whatever, you know, the network kind of reallocates. And the significance  of this idea is not just that it led to the internet. The other significance is AT&T thought  it was the craziest idea they'd ever heard. Yeah, yeah. Right, right. Because you need control.  You need control and control. There's no central control.  Yeah, yeah. And I was reading, I just before this, I was refreshing myself and I read Paul  Baran's obituary in the New York Times and Vince Turf has quoted in the obituary saying that, you  know, Paul Baran was basically a laughed out of AT&T when he proposed this idea.  Right. Because it was such a heretical idea. So anyway, so the point being is the internet  was a heretical idea from the very beginning. And I thought in both in that it would never work  because it'd be like entirely too slow and the packet reassembly and all that would never work.  And then also that it was a dumb idea because of course, you want central control. So like,  they derided him in every direction possible. Yeah, yeah. Well, as late as that was 1964,  20 years later. Horrible idea that would never work.  Horrible idea that will never work exactly right. So that was 1964 when he proposed this as late,  20 years later in 1984, a federal judge went to break up AT&T, which at that time was the  National Telecom Monopoly. They owned and controlled everything. And AT&T actually got the Secretary  of Defense in 1984, 20 years later to testify that that if the federal judge broke up AT&T,  it would permanently cripple the US's command and control capability for nuclear weapons.  Right. And so even 20 years later, people didn't believe it. It was still a heretical idea.  And by the way, 84 is significant because of course, the very next year in 85 is when the NSF  Net was funded. And so it was like a 20 year journey to get from that original heretical idea  with resistance all the way through to ultimately get to the point where Al Gore and his colleagues  figured out that actually, no, it was actually a good idea and they should actually put money in it.  So what I'd really like to know, and I think a lot of people would is,  so you have this network with some supercomputers on it and a bunch of scientists  and some news groups, like, how did you get to this idea? Because nobody else had the idea.  First of all, nobody else had the idea. And then secondly, if you had not had the idea when you had  it, the internet as we know it probably doesn't happen in that the kind of Microsoft alternative,  the Oracle alternative would have had an opportunity to gain a network effect.  And so the chance of all this getting built, I mean, maybe if it was invented six months later,  but four years later, definitely not. And so what happened?  Yeah, so there were serious efforts underway. You alluded to this, but there were serious  efforts at the time. So let's just itemize the efforts. And so there were three, basically,  consumer online services that came out of the 80s, AOL, CompuServe and Prodigy.  AOL became famous later, much, much larger. CompuServe kind of petered out at one point.  Prodigy was actually an IBM joint venture, so they were actually kind of clued into that part  of it early. And then those systems existed in the early 90s. And those were all these  sort of proprietary stovepipes not interconnected, not open. These are by definition closed systems.  And for people who don't remember this, if you wanted to put content up on AOL,  you had to pay AOL. And you had to get their permission, their approval, and they could take  it down. And so it was sort of any of these stovepipe proprietary things, somebody really  is in charge. And the internet is the opposite of that. And so those systems ran like that.  And then there were a set of companies that then you're alluding to that we're going to do the  leapfrog on that and kind of do the modern gooey version of that. And that was specifically  Microsoft with MSN. The time was called MSN. And then Apple had something at the time called eWorld.  And then who else was running around a whole bunch of these other companies were running. And then  the media companies were doing these proprietary video interaction TV things that would also be  centralized controlled. But yeah, in particular, I think probably at the time it was really that  the big ones would have been AOL getting really big. It would have been  Microsoft establishing its own kind of permanent proprietary online service  as an alternative to the internet. And then it would have been probably Apple with its own  proprietary system. Probably would have been the big three. And look, those companies would have  loved for that to happen. Like all three of those companies would have been much better off had that  happened. You get a big on every transaction. Yeah, this is actually the famous, Ben just  used the word big. So there was a famous interview with Microsoft CTO at the time that they were  trying to make MSN work. Nathan Mirvold and interesting guy. And he said, yeah, he said,  and he actually to his credit, he kind of said it out loud. He said, yeah, the goal of this program  is to get a big of ever online transaction, you know, big being the mafia term for, you know,  your slice of the pie. Yeah, vigorous, vigorous. Exactly. So and, you know, yeah, they would  have had, you know, they would have had total control. And so if you think about the level  of control that big tech has today, like it would have been like that times 10. And that really  was where the industry was headed. And and those companies had a big advantage at the time, because  if not one is they just had tremendous resources, like they were funded to do this. And then the  other thing is that, you know, you at the time, you know, look, to just get this stuff to work  was hard. And they could marshal thousands of engineers, and they could design everything to  work in a completely integrated manner. And they had, you know, all these graphic designers to  make it beautiful. And they had all these performance engineers to make it fast. And,  you know, they could run big advertising campaigns and do consumers, you know,  do consumer support. And I'll tell the story later of how I became the consumer support,  I became the user support desk for the entire internet for about a year and a half.  Myself, it's an amazing, you know, amazing job, they would have had, you know, they would have  had the ability to, you know, they had a lot of natural advantages to be able to do it in the  proprietary way that they wanted. And so this was a critical period for that. Yeah, the internet,  as we know it today, didn't have to happen. Yeah, so basically, I think in retrospect,  what just happened was a couple of things. So one is just the generation of super geniuses,  like Paul Baran, and, you know, your friend, you know, Len Kleinrock, and Vint Cerf, and,  you know, these, these, all these really bright guys who had created the internet as,  as, you know, kind of the network side of it, you know, they just, they were networking people,  and they just didn't, they didn't, their natural, you know, kind of world was not user interfaces  and consumer services, and content, and media, and, you know, gaming, and, you know, all these,  all these, all these application level things, you know, they just, they, the way these systems  are built is they just assume somebody else is going to do all that. And, and that hadn't really  happened yet. And so, yeah, so just part of it was people, they hadn't tried. Part of it was,  it wasn't a business. And so there was no business motivation to try to do it. And then also part  of it was, there was another coincidental thing that happened, which was the arrival of the, of  the graphical PC. And so the arrivals, the arrival specifically of the Macintosh, and then followed  by that the arrival of Windows, Windows version three, and the, and the first graphical PCs. And  so the, you know, before about 1992 or so, you weren't going to have a graphical user interface  to anything, because you didn't have graphical user interfaces at all. And so there was also a  moment in time thing that happened there. So there was all that. Yeah. And so then my, my part of  the story was, I was, I had a bunch of jobs in college and was getting my computer science degree.  And then I ended up working for what's called NCSA, which was the National Center for Super  Computer Applications, which was- And you're a freshman at the time or a sophomore when you got  that job? No, so I actually didn't get, I actually didn't start working there until I was a junior.  So I worked, when I was a freshman, I worked in a physics lab called the Materials Research Lab  there, which was actually a great entry point for me, because that was one of the main labs using  the big supercomputers. Yeah. And so I kind of got plugged into that world very early. And then I,  and then my sophomore year, I spent nine months actually as a co-op student working for IBM  in Austin. And I worked on the workstations at the time, which was again, very helpful for this,  because these were kind of the leading edge user interface, you know, so like I worked on graphics  systems. And they had TCPIP, right? The workstations, yeah. They were built in. And then IBM in Austin  at the time, you know, this is when IBM was on top of the world, it was, you know, by far the most  important tech company still at that point. And, you know, we had this, we had a 6,000 person  division in Austin working on these Unix workstations at the time, graphical workstations. And again,  they had the resources, everybody there was also wired, everybody was on the internet,  these workstations were designed to be used on the internet. Right. And I was at the time did not  have any internet capability. You know, there was no, in the early 90s, there was no TCPIP,  there was never none of it. Yeah, well, computers, you recall this, yeah, computers,  PCs and Macs up until 93, 94, didn't even come with TCPIP built into the computer,  built into the operating system. Right. We had to actually, you actually had to buy it,  what was called the TCPIP stack is a separate thing. Windsock. Windsock and these things.  And so yeah, but the Unix workstations of that era, you know, the problem with the Unix workstations"
