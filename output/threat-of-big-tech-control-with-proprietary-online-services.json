    "description": "The podcast highlighted the threat posed by big tech companies like Microsoft, Apple, and AOL establishing permanent proprietary online services as an alternative to the internet. These closed systems aimed to exert total control over content and transactions, with the goal of gaining a 'big' or slice of every online transaction.",

    "text": " efforts at the time. So let's just itemize the efforts. And so there were three, basically,  consumer online services that came out of the 80s, AOL, CompuServe and Prodigy.  AOL became famous later, much, much larger. CompuServe kind of petered out at one point.  Prodigy was actually an IBM joint venture, so they were actually kind of clued into that part  of it early. And then those systems existed in the early 90s. And those were all these  sort of proprietary stovepipes not interconnected, not open. These are by definition closed systems.  And for people who don't remember this, if you wanted to put content up on AOL,  you had to pay AOL. And you had to get their permission, their approval, and they could take  it down. And so it was sort of any of these stovepipe proprietary things, somebody really  is in charge. And the internet is the opposite of that. And so those systems ran like that.  And then there were a set of companies that then you're alluding to that we're going to do the  leapfrog on that and kind of do the modern gooey version of that. And that was specifically  Microsoft with MSN. The time was called MSN. And then Apple had something at the time called eWorld.  And then who else was running around a whole bunch of these other companies were running. And then  the media companies were doing these proprietary video interaction TV things that would also be  centralized controlled. But yeah, in particular, I think probably at the time it was really that  the big ones would have been AOL getting really big. It would have been  Microsoft establishing its own kind of permanent proprietary online service  as an alternative to the internet. And then it would have been probably Apple with its own  proprietary system. Probably would have been the big three. And look, those companies would have  loved for that to happen. Like all three of those companies would have been much better off had that  happened. You get a big on every transaction. Yeah, this is actually the famous, Ben just  used the word big. So there was a famous interview with Microsoft CTO at the time that they were  trying to make MSN work. Nathan Mirvold and interesting guy. And he said, yeah, he said,  and he actually to his credit, he kind of said it out loud. He said, yeah, the goal of this program  is to get a big of ever online transaction, you know, big being the mafia term for, you know,  your slice of the pie. Yeah, vigorous, vigorous. Exactly. So and, you know, yeah, they would  have had, you know, they would have had total control. And so if you think about the level  of control that big tech has today, like it would have been like that times 10. And that really  was where the industry was headed. And and those companies had a big advantage at the time, because  if not one is they just had tremendous resources, like they were funded to do this. And then the  other thing is that, you know, you at the time, you know, look, to just get this stuff to work  was hard. And they could marshal thousands of engineers, and they could design everything to  work in a completely integrated manner. And they had, you know, all these graphic designers to  make it beautiful. And they had all these performance engineers to make it fast. And,  you know, they could run big advertising campaigns and do consumers, you know,  do consumer support. And I'll tell the story later of how I became the consumer support,  I became the user support desk for the entire internet for about a year and a half.  Myself, it's an amazing, you know, amazing job, they would have had, you know, they would have  had the ability to, you know, they had a lot of natural advantages to be able to do it in the  proprietary way that they wanted. And so this was a critical period for that. Yeah, the internet,  as we know it today, didn't have to happen. Yeah, so basically, I think in retrospect,  what just happened was a couple of things. So one is just the generation of super geniuses,  like Paul Baran, and, you know, your friend, you know, Len Kleinrock, and Vint Cerf, and,  you know, these, these, all these really bright guys who had created the internet as,  as, you know, kind of the network side of it, you know, they just, they were networking people,  and they just didn't, they didn't, their natural, you know, kind of world was not user interfaces  and consumer services, and content, and media, and, you know, gaming, and, you know, all these,  all these, all these application level things, you know, they just, they, the way these systems  are built is they just assume somebody else is going to do all that. And, and that hadn't really  happened yet. And so, yeah, so just part of it was people, they hadn't tried. Part of it was,  it wasn't a business. And so there was no business motivation to try to do it. And then also part  of it was, there was another coincidental thing that happened, which was the arrival of the, of  the graphical PC. And so the arrivals, the arrival specifically of the Macintosh, and then followed  by that the arrival of Windows, Windows version three, and the, and the first graphical PCs. And  so the, you know, before about 1992 or so, you weren't going to have a graphical user interface  to anything, because you didn't have graphical user interfaces at all. And so there was also a  moment in time thing that happened there. So there was all that. Yeah. And so then my, my part of  the story was, I was, I had a bunch of jobs in college and was getting my computer science degree.  And then I ended up working for what's called NCSA, which was the National Center for Super  Computer Applications, which was- And you're a freshman at the time or a sophomore when you got  that job? No, so I actually didn't get, I actually didn't start working there until I was a junior.  So I worked, when I was a freshman, I worked in a physics lab called the Materials Research Lab  there, which was actually a great entry point for me, because that was one of the main labs using  the big supercomputers. Yeah. And so I kind of got plugged into that world very early. And then I,  and then my sophomore year, I spent nine months actually as a co-op student working for IBM  in Austin. And I worked on the workstations at the time, which was again, very helpful for this,  because these were kind of the leading edge user interface, you know, so like I worked on graphics  systems. And they had TCPIP, right? The workstations, yeah. They were built in. And then IBM in Austin  at the time, you know, this is when IBM was on top of the world, it was, you know, by far the most  important tech company still at that point. And, you know, we had this, we had a 6,000 person  division in Austin working on these Unix workstations at the time, graphical workstations. And again,  they had the resources, everybody there was also wired, everybody was on the internet,  these workstations were designed to be used on the internet. Right. And I was at the time did not  have any internet capability. You know, there was no, in the early 90s, there was no TCPIP,  there was never none of it. Yeah, well, computers, you recall this, yeah, computers,  PCs and Macs up until 93, 94, didn't even come with TCPIP built into the computer,  built into the operating system. Right. We had to actually, you actually had to buy it,  what was called the TCPIP stack is a separate thing. Windsock. Windsock and these things.  And so yeah, but the Unix workstations of that era, you know, the problem with the Unix workstations  is they cost like $50,000. And so these were not consumer products. But if you had one, you had"
