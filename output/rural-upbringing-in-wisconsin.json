And for people who haven't spent time in Wisconsin, there's, you know,  there's, there's basically three Wisconsin's, there's the, there's sort of the big city of Milwaukee,  which is like a very kind of, you know, kind of like a bit, almost like a Chicago, you know,  kind of thing. Then there's, but that's its own world. And then there's Madison, which is like a  very kind of hippie college town. Right. That was actually kind of a core of activity in the 60s.  And then there's the rest of Wisconsin, which is completely disconnected from those two cities,  which has nothing to do and has no interface into those two places at all, and is sort of the,  the rural Midwest, which is, you know, basically a farming country. And so,  actually, as I understand it,  Yeah, I think that's right. Yes. And so if you get 10 minutes outside of either, you know,  Milwaukee or Madison, you get into a rural, you know, real, real rural territory, you know,  in a, in a hurry. Right. And so, and, you know, this is, you know, I was, you know, there were  people in the, you know, the, in the farming world in the Midwest, you know, up through the 1970s,  that still didn't have indoor plumbing. Right. So like, you know, I, you know, I, you know, I,  I have, I have memories of outhouses. And, you know,  Well, for a while, you didn't have gas heat. So you weren't there for  There's also that exactly. So yes, if you want to heat your house, you cut down some wood.  And so, and yeah, and then, you know, look, it's up, it's up north and it's, you know,  very close to Canada. So it's extremely cold. And so it's actually kind of a, it's this amazing  thing where it sort of frozen tundra for nine months, and then three months of, of summer.  And then, you know, but mostly farming, you know, a lot of dairy farming, you know, a lot of corn  to feed, to feed the cows. So corn and cows. And then I'd say, you know, light manufacturing,  light tourism, you know, a lot of, a lot of Illinois people vacation up there, go hunting,  fishing or whatever. So, you know, a little bit of that, but mostly, mostly agricultural. Yeah.  And my town was sort of a populate sign of the outside of town forever, population 1300 and nine.  And you know, the sign never changed.  And a hearing journalist of whether you had 1308 or 1310.  Yeah, I don't think it actually moved around that much. So it's probably more or less accurate the  whole time. And then, and then of course, the running joke was that's 1300 and nine, including the  cows. So, so yeah, so very small town environment. So yeah, so, you know, kind of lower middle class,  you know, context and, you know, public public, you know, public eight through 12 school,  you know, 20 of my school was very small, 25 kids in a class.  So, you know, whatever 300 kids in the whole school.  Oh, a lot of people don't have a school choice today. You didn't have teacher choice either,  because here's, I guess, one teacher for every subject.  No, no, exactly. And then, you know, this is the 70s, this is the 70s, and then the 80s. And so,  you know, this, this predates not only predates the internet, you know, but this also predates  cable TV, you know, we had no cable TV, we had, you know, long distance phone calls,  we're still a dollar a minute. We still actually, my neighborhood growing up,  actually, we had a party phone line for the entire neighborhood.  That's interesting, which is actually quite, quite an adventure. And so,  there's a single phone number for the neighborhood. And so, when your phone rings,  everybody in the neighborhood picks up the phone. This is true. And then there's a,  there's an arbitration process, a verbal arbitration process for who the calls actually  for. And then the expectation, the expectation is that everybody else hangs up, but, you know,  they don't have to. Well, they say there are no secrets in the small town.  This is, this is, this is one of the reasons why. So, so, yeah, I mean, it was just, you know,  sort of, yeah, so it's sort of, you know, as I don't know, it's halfway between, you know,  it's halfway between the 1930s and the 1980s or something. It just is one of those places where,"
